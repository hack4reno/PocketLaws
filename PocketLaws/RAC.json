Jones\nCity Clerk \n\nPREFACE \n\nThis Republication constitutes a complete republication of the ordinances of the City of Reno of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included herein or recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto. \n\nSource materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1981 Code as supplemented through January 2006 and ordinances subsequently adopted by the governing body. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the Comparative Tables appearing in the back of the volume, the reader can locate any section of the 1966 Code, 1981 Code and any subsequent ordinance included herein. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this volume. \n\nNumbering System \n\nThe Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, section 18.12.050 is Section .050, located in Chapter 12 of Title 18. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. \n\nIndex \n\nThe index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which he is interested. \n\nAcknowledgments \n\nThe publication of this Code was under the direct supervision of John Dombroski, Vice-President for Production and Anne Wilson and Janet Cramer, Editors, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other member's of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. \n\n MUNICIPAL CODE CORPORATION \n Tallahassee, Florida \n March, 2006 \n\nBILL NO. 3341\nORDINANCE NO. 2955 \n\nAn Ordinance Adopting and Enacting a New Code for the City of Reno, Nevada; Establishing the Same; Providing for the Repeal of Certain Ordinances Not Included Therein; Providing for the Manner of Amending and Supplementing Such Code; and Providing When Such Code and this Ordinance Shall Become Effective. \n\nThe City Council of the City of Reno do Ordain: \n\nSection 1.

That all provisions of such Code shall be in full force and effect from any after January 1, 1982, and all ordinances of a general and permanent nature of the City of Reno, adopted on final passage on or before December 8, 1980, and not included in such Code or recognized and continued in force by reference therein, are hereby repealed from and after the effective date of such Code. \n\nSection 3. That the repeal provided for in Section 2 hereof shall not be construed to revive any ordinance or part thereof that has been repealed by a subsequent ordinance which is repealed by this ordinance. \n\nSection 4. Unless another penalty is expressly provided; a violation of any provision of such Code, or any provision of any rule or regulation adopted or issued pursuant thereto, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one dollar ($1.00) and not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or be punished by imprisonment in the city jail not to exceed six (6) months, or be punished by both fine and imprisonment, as provided in Section 1.04.010 of such Code. \n\nSection 5. Any and all additions and amendments to such Code, when passed in such form as to indicate the intention of the City Council to make the same a part of such Code, shall be deemed to be incorporated in such Code, so that reference to such Code shall be understood and intended to include such additions and amendments. \n\nSection 6. That in case of the amendment of any section of such Code for which a penalty is not provided, the general penalty, as provided in Section 4 of the ordinance and in Section 1.04.010 of such Code shall apply to the section as amended, or in case such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same chapter, the penalty so provided in such other section shall be held to relate to the section so amended, unless such penalty is specifically repealed therein. \n\nSection 7. Any ordinance adopted after December 8, 1980, which amends or refers to sections of the 1966 Reno Municipal Code, which have been codified in this Code, shall be construed as if they amend or refer to like provisions of such Code. \n\nPASSED AND ADOPTED this 28th day of September, 1981, by the following vote of the Council: \n\nAYES: McCLELLAND, SFERRAZZA, LEHNERS, THORNTON, PINE, SCOTT, BENNETT \n\nNAYS: NONE \n\nABSTAIN: NONE  ABSENT: NONE \n\nAPPROVED this 28th day of September 1981. \n\n;sigr;\\Barbara J.

It is expressly declared as the intent of the Legislature that all provisions of this Charter be liberally construed to carry out the express purposes of the Charter and that the specific mention of particular powers shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers necessary to carry out the purposes of the Charter. \n\n2.\nAny powers expressly granted by this Charter are in addition to any powers granted to a city by the general law of this state. All provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes which are applicable generally to cities (not including, unless otherwise expressly mentioned in this Charter, chapter 265, 266 or 267 of NRS) which are not in conflict with the provisions of this Charter apply to the City of Reno. \n\n(Ch. 662, Stats. 1971 p. 1962) \n\nSec. 1.020. - Incorporation of City.\n\n1.\nAll persons who are inhabitants of that portion of the State of Nevada embraced within the limits set forth in section 1.030 shall constitute a political and corporate body by the name of \"City of Reno\" and by that name they and their successors shall be known in law, have perpetual succession and may sue and be sued in all courts. \n\n2.\nWhenever used throughout this charter, \"City\" means the City of Reno.\n\n(Ch. 662, Stats. 1971 p. 1962) \n\nSec. 1.030. - Description of territory.\n\n1.\nThe territory embraced in the City is that certain land described in the official plat required by NRS 234.250 to be filed with the County Recorder and County Assessor of Washoe County, as such plat is amended from time to time. \n\n2.\nThe territory described in paragraph (a) of subsection 2 of section 1 of article I of chapter 180, Statutes of Nevada 1949, lying within the City of Reno is hereby detached from the City of Reno and is included within the boundaries of the City of Sparks. \n\n(Ch. 662, Stats. 1971 p. 1962; A-Ch. 482, Stats. 1973 p. 714) \n\nSec. 1.040. - Annexations.\n\nThe City may annex territory by following the procedure provided for the annexation of cities in those sections of chapter 268 of NRS, as amended from time to time, which apply to a county whose population is less than 400,000. \n\n(Ch. 662, Stats. 1971 p. 1962; A-Ch. 65, Stats. 1981 p. 159; Ch. 796, Stats. 1989 p. 1936) \n\nSec. 1.050. - Wards: Creation; boundaries.\n\n1.\nThe City must be divided into five wards, which must be as nearly equal in population as can be conveniently provided. The territory comprising each ward must be contiguous, except that if any territory of the City which is not contiguous to the remainder of the City does not contain sufficient population to constitute a separate ward, it may be placed in any ward of the City. \n\n2.\nThe boundaries of the wards must be established and changed by ordinance, passed by a vote of at least five-sevenths of the City Council. The boundaries of the wards: \n\n(a)\nMust be changed whenever the population, as determined by the last preceding national census of the Bureau of the Census of the United States Department of Commerce, in any ward exceeds the population in any other ward by more than 5 percent. \n\n(b)\nMay be changed to include territory that has been annexed, or whenever the population in any ward exceeds the population in another ward by more than 5 percent by any measure that is found to be reliable by the City Council. \n\n(Ch. 662, Stats. 1971 p. 1963; A-Ch. 553, Stats. 1973 p. 875; Ch. 65, Stats. 1981 p. 159; Ch. 9, Stats. 1993 p. 20; Ch. 327, Stats. 1999 p. 1365) \n\nSec. 1.060. - Elective offices.\n\n1.\nThe elective officers of the City consist of:\n\n(a)\nA Mayor.\n\n(b)\nSix Councilmen.\n\n(c)\nOne Municipal Judge and as many additional judges as the City Council deems necessary.\n\n(d)\nA City Attorney.\n\n2.\nSuch officers shall be elected as provided by this Charter.\n\n(Ch. 662, Stats. 1971 p. 1963; A-Ch. 553, Stats. 1973 p. 876; Ch. 561, Stats. 1977 p. 1390; Ch. 373, Stats. 1979 p. 644) \n\nSec. 1.070. - Elective offices: Vacancies.\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in NRS 268.325: \n\n1.\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, a vacancy in the City Council or in the office of City Attorney or Municipal Judge must be filled by a majority vote of the members of the City Council within 30 days after the occurrence of the vacancy. A person may be selected to fill a prospective vacancy in the City Council before the vacancy occurs. In such a case, each member of the Council, except any member whose term of office expires before the occurrence of the vacancy, may participate in any action taken by the Council pursuant to this section. The appointee must have the same qualifications as are required of the elective official. \n\n2.\nThe appointee shall serve until the next general municipal election and until his successor is elected and qualified. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 5.010 of this Charter to the contrary, the office must be filled by election at the next general municipal election. If that election is other than the election specified in section 5.010 of this Charter for the filing of the office, the election is only for the balance of the unexpired term for that office. \n\n3.\nIf a vacancy occurs in an office of City Council, in lieu of appointment, the City Council may, by resolution, declare a special election to fill the vacancy. The special election must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the resolution declaring the special election and section 5.030 of this Charter. \n\n\n(Ch. 662, Stats. 1971 p. 1963; A-Ch. 854, Stats. 1989 p. 2061; Ch. 210, Stats. 1997 p. 733; Ch. 515, Stats. 1997 p. 2452) \n\nSec. 1.080. - Mayor and Councilmen not to hold other office or employment.\n\n1.\nThe Mayor and Councilmen shall not:\n\n(a)\nHold any other elective office or employment with Washoe County or the City, except as provided by law or as a member of a board or commission for which no compensation is received. \n\n(b)\nBe appointed to any office or position created by or the compensation for which was increased or fixed by the City Council until 1 year after the expiration of the term for which such person was elected. \n\n2.\nAny person who violates the provisions of subsection 1 shall automatically forfeit his office.\n\n(Ch. 662, Stats. 1971 p. 1963; A-Ch. 561, Stats. 1977 p. 1390; Ch. 327, Stats. 1999 p. 1366) \n\nATTORNEY GENERAL'S OPINIONS. \n\nProvision of city charter prohibiting mayor or member of city council from being employed by county was unconstitutional as applied to the facts presented. Where an employee of Nye County was elected to the position of mayor of Gabbs and an employee of Elko County was elected to the Wells city council, city charter provisions (see former Gabbs City Charter  1.080 and Wells City Charter  1.070) prohibiting the mayor or a city councilman from holding employment with the county were unconstitutional pursuant to the U.S. 1st amendment (cf. Nev. Art. 1,  9 and 10), at least where the two county employees: (1) were not elected to their county positions; (2) did not hold county positions involving the exercise of political power or discretionary decision making; (3) could have no pecuniary conflict, because the city council does not regulate the county budget; (4) had supervisors that worked for the county, not the city; and (5) held positions with the county such that they could continue to be loyal to their employers while at the same time being loyal to their city constituents. Although certain interests may justify a restriction on certain county and possibly all city employees from also holding seats on the city council, they do not justify a complete ban on all county employees from also being elected mayor or city councilman. (See also Caliente City Charter  1.070, Carlin City Charter  1.070, Las Vegas City Charter  2.040 and Reno City Charter  1.080.) AGO 99-21 (7-2-1999) \n\nEffect of section on increase of salary for next term with respect to person running for reelection. Notwithstanding the provisions of NRS 266.230, Carlin City Charter  1.070(1)(b), Elko City Charter  1.100(1)(b) and Wells City Charter  1.070(1)(b), which require certain city officials to wait until 1 year after the expiration of their term of office before being elected or appointed to another office the compensation for which was increased during their previous term of office, the presumption in favor of the eligibility of a person who has been elected to public office mandates the outcome that if a current city council or board of supervisors of the city increases the salaries for the next term of office, a mayor or city councilman or city supervisor may run for reelection and does not need to absent himself from office for 1 year. However, the salary increase would not take effect for such a reelected official until 1 year later. (See also Henderson City Charter  1.080(1)(b), Las Vegas City Charter  2.040(1)(b), North Las Vegas City Charter  1.070(1)(b) and Sparks City Charter  1.100(1)(b).) (N.B., Reno City Charter  1.080(1)(b) was amended in 1999 to clarify that a city councilman or mayor who votes for a salary increase and is then reelected is entitled to the salary increase beginning in his new term.)

Thus, the supreme court concluded that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on the basis that the appellant was an at-will employee. The supreme court further concluded that the appellant could only be removed for cause as provided by the City Charter at the time at which he accepted his job. Pressler v.

Where a resident of the city of Reno alleged that the Reno City Council violated the open meeting law (see NRS ch. 241) because the city attorney was not present at a meeting of the city council when the meeting was called to order, the attorney general determined that no violation of the open meeting law took place because: (1) the open meeting law does not require the attorney for a public body to be present at an open meeting; and (2) although the Reno City Charter requires the city attorney to be present at all meetings of the city council (see Reno City Charter  3.060), the attorney general does not have jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the city charter.

All witnesses must be under oath. The accused has the right to be heard in person and by attorney in his own defense and is entitled to secure the attendance of witnesses at the expense of the City if within the reach of the Commission's subpoena and necessary for his defense. Upon a showing of necessity an accused may secure from the Commission an order requiring the taking of depositions of witnesses who are necessary to his defense and not within the reach of a subpoena. The Commission shall determine to what extent the expense of such depositions will be paid for by the City. Hearings on appeal must be reported and may be transcribed if a transcript is necessary for a deliberation of the Commission or for an appeal to the district court. The Commission shall render its decision within 7 days after the date of the hearing. \n\n4.\nThe action taken by the City Manager may be affirmed, modified or revoked by the Commission.

The council recognizes that enforcement starts with the implementation of regulations that can be applied in administrative enforcement hearings and appropriate appeals. The council further finds that a comprehensive Code Enforcement system requires a variety of administrative remedies for the effective enforcement of violations of the Code. The procedures established in this chapter shall be in addition to any civil or any other legal remedy established by law which may be pursued to address violations of the Code. The use of procedures established in this chapter, except as specifically provided otherwise, shall be in lieu of criminal sanctions. \n\nThe council also finds that there is a need to establish uniform procedures for administrative enforcement hearings conducted pursuant to the Code. It is the purpose and intent of the council to establish uniform minimum procedural requirements for administrative enforcement and adjudication procedures for the Code, and to provide for an administrative hearing and appeal. \n\n(Ord.

No. 5063,  1, 11-9-99) \n\nSec. 1.05.015. - Administrative enforcement authority.\n\nThe enforcement official shall have the authority and powers necessary to determine whether a violation of the Code exists and the authority to take appropriate action to gain compliance with the provisions of the Code. These powers include the power to issue notices of violation, administrative citations, misdemeanor citations, notices and orders, the power to inspect public and private property and use the administrative remedies which are available under the Code. \n\n(Ord.

No. 4763,  1, adopted July 8, 1997, repealed Title 4, in its entirety, which pertained to business licenses and regulations. Subsequently, Ord. No. 4764, adopted July 8, 1997, added a new Ch. 4.04 to read as herein set out. See the Code Comparative Table. \n\n\nCharter reference- Authority to regulate and impose a license tax for revenue upon all businesses, trades and professions,  2.140. \n\nState law reference- Power of municipal governing bodies to fix, impose and collect license taxes on all lawful businesses, NRS 268.095. \n\nCase law reference-(1) City license and county license may be required for the same business. If a person combines within himself more than one distinct occupation or business, he could be compelled to take out a license for each occupation or business. Ex parte Siebenhaur, 14 Nev. 365 (1879). \n\n\n(2) Licensee takes his license subject to such conditions as the legislature sees fit to impose. Wallace v. Mayor of City of Reno, 27 Nev. 71, 73 Pac. 528, 63 L.R.A. 337, 103 Am. St. Rep. 747 (1903). \n\n\n\n(3) Purpose of an exaction from the public in the form of a tax or license, either for revenue or in the exercise of the police power, is for the benefit of the locality from which the money is collected. State v. Boyd, 27 Nev. 249, 74 Pac. 654 (1903). \n\n\n\n(4) Under our statutes and decisions it is well settled that a license may be revoked. State v. Reno City Council, 36 Nev. 334, 136 Pac. 110, 50 L.R.A. (N.S.) 195 (1913). \n\n\n\n(5) Under city ordinance providing that every person engaged in the business of selling at retail, or any manner other than at a fixed place of business within the city, any goods, wares, or merchandise shall obtain a license, a person owning a place of business outside the city limits where he manufactured and compounded certain articles used in the grocery trade, and acting as his own salesman, solicited orders in the city and sold to restaurants, hotels, bakeries, and confectioners other kinds of groceries than manufactured and compounded by him, in both small and large quantities and in broken and unbroken packages, and filled orders given to him by such customers, is a retailer and liable for the license mentioned in the ordinance. Bryan v. City of Sparks, 36 Nev. 573, Pac. 522 (1913). \n\n\n\n(6) \"The reasons given for sustaining the requirement of a bond are manifest and convincing as set forth in Ex Parte Cardinal (Calif.) 150 Pac. 348: `We see no reason to doubt the power of the state, or any county or municipality, in the exercise of its police power of regulation, to require security in the shape of a bond or insurance policy from its licensees in all cases where the giving of such security may fairly be held to a reasonable requirement for the protection of the public'.\" Ex parte Counts, 39 Nev. 61, 153 Pac. 93 (1915). \n\n\n\n(7) An admission to the bar of a state is a vested and valuable right, but subject to taxation, including a city occupation tax. The imposition of a license tax upon an occupation is not illegal, because not expressly authorized by the state constitution, but is permissible, unless prohibited thereby. There is no inherent vice in the taxation of vocations. On the contrary, business is as legitimate an object of the taxing power as property. Ex parte Dixon, 43 Nev. 196, 183 Pac. 642 (1919). \n\n\n\n(8) Charter of Carson City which after enumerating many kinds of business upon which the city is authorized to impose a license tax, authorizes it to fix and have collected a license tax on all trades, professions, and classes of business not thereinbefore specified. \"To the layman this provision would be clear and unequivocal, needing no interpretation, elucidation, amplification, or consideration. Why not so in the realm of jurisprudence? To the layman it no doubt appears at a glance that this general provision could have but one meaning, purpose, or object, for the discovery of which no prolonged or profound search should be necessary, namely, to make subject to a tax levy any business, trade or profession which through oversight had been omitted from the list of businesses enumerated ... The sole purpose of the legislation was to enable the city to bring all kinds of business within its taxing power.\" Carson City v. Red Arrow Garage Auto Co., 47 Nev. 473, 225 Pac. 487 (1924). \n\n\n\n(9) Power of the legislature under constitution to tax a business is ... settled, and the authority to delegate it to municipal corporations cannot be questioned.

Thereafter, and prior to issuance of a license, review and approval will be obtained from all applicable reviewing bodies including, but not limited to building, planning, fire, police, city council and relevant district, county and state agencies. \n\nIn the event that a complete police department background investigation has not been completed and approval has not been obtained, but all other relevant reviewing body approvals have been obtained, and no sooner than 30 days after submission of a properly completed application, the applicant may execute an interim privileged license declaration form to obtain an interim license under which to operate until final police department approval is obtained and a full license is issued. The full 30-day waiting period would not be applicable to a licensee who holds a current privileged license at a current location and submits a new application for a new location. The licensee's new application would be eligible for a shorter time if the currently licensed location is being conducted in a way, or is attracting conditions, that do not threaten public health, safety or welfare of persons within or nearby the business. \n\nAn applicant seeking such an interim license acknowledges the background investigation delay and stipulates that, if the police department recommends denial, and the license is denied as a result, the business activity shall immediately cease upon receiving license denial notice. Appropriate conditions or limitations relating to the interim period may be imposed upon the interim license, and the applicant shall hold the city harmless from any damages or claims arising out of its operation pursuant to the interim license. \n\n(i)\nUpon completion of the background investigation, the privileged license may be summarily revoked based upon the results of the police department background investigation.

The city council finds that a mix of commercial uses attractive to tourists and residents is a necessary ingredient to a vital downtown. The city has expended large sums of money to make downtown viable through the redevelopment agency. The city council wants to provide the opportunity for the efforts of the redevelopment agency to come to fruition prior to its expiration in 2017. The city finds that the present ratio of pawn shops to population is too high and should not be increased in the future. The city hereby establishes the preferred ratio of pawn shops to population as the number licensed and in operation downtown in 1991, less one, divided by population, or one pawnshop per 15,500 residents. \n\n(a)\nLicenses may be approved at a rate of one for every 15,500 residents. The basis for determining population increase shall be the City of Reno Community Development Department monthly population projection. \n\n(b)\nThe city recognizes all pawnbrokers with approved business licenses or special use permits who received these permits prior to April 30, 1992 and maintain them in good standing. \n\n(c)\nThe city council shall establish a procedure for selecting licensees when more licenses can be approved.\n\n\n(Ord.

Drivers turning in the direction of the arrow are thereby advised that so long as the turn arrow is illuminated, oncoming or opposing traffic simultaneously faces a steady red signal. \n\n(2)\nPedestrians facing such a signal shall not enter the highway unless permitted to proceed by another device as provided in section 6.06.350 \n\n(h)\nIf a traffic-control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions, which by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or pavement marking indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of any such device, the stop shall be made at the signal. \n\n(i)\nWhenever traffic-control signals are placed over the individual lanes of a highway, such signals shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles as follows: \n\n(1)\nA downward-pointing green arrow means that a driver facing such signal may drive in any lane over which the green signal is shown. \n\n(2)\nA red \"X\" symbol means a driver facing such signal shall not enter or drive in any lane over which such red signal is shown.\n\n(Code 1966,  8.16.050; Ord.

Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by the rules as set forth in section 6.06.200 \n\n(Code 1966,  8.16.070) \n\nState law reference- Similar provisions, NRS 484.285. \n\nSec. 6.06.085. - Display of unauthorized signs, signals or markings.\n\n(a)\nNo person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any highway an unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic-control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or which hides from view or interferes with the effectiveness of any official traffic-control device or any railroad sign or signal. \n\n(b)\nNo person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority permit upon any highway any traffic sign or signal bearing thereon any commercial advertising. \n\n(c)\nThis section shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection upon private property adjacent to highways of signs giving useful directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official signs. \n\n(d)\nEvery such prohibited sign, signal or marking is hereby declared to be a public nuisance and the authority having jurisdiction over the highway is hereby empowered to remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice. \n\n(Code 1966,  8.16.080) \n\nState law reference- Similar provisions, NRS 484.287. \n\nSec. 6.06.090. - Interference, destruction and obstruction of traffic-control devices or railroad signs or signals, and obstruction of vision at intersections.\n\n(a)\nNo person shall, without lawful authority, attempt to, or in fact, alter, deface, injure, knock down or remove any traffic-control device or any railroad sign or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any other part thereof. \n\n(b)\nIt is unlawful for any person to hide or obscure any official traffic-control device, railroad signal or signals, by the erection of any object, or by allowing bushes, trees or other vegetation to grow and obscure the same. \n\n(c)\nIt is unlawful for the property owner or occupant on all lots, regardless of zone classification, to allow any sign, fence, ornamental hedge, shrub, tree, display or any other object obstructing any part of the sidewalk, or, to allow structures, signs, hedges, shrubbery, natural growth, berms, mounds, or other obstructions not covered under subsection (d), to obstruct the stopping sight distance of motorists. \n\n(d)\nClear view areas shall be established at all intersections that are not controlled by all way stop signs or traffic signals. The clear view area shall be determined by the appropriate sight distance as defined in the latest edition of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO), A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets, Chapter IX - \"At Grade Intersections\" and shall be provided at all intersections. Clear view areas at uncontrolled intersections where the posted speed is 25 miles per hour or less, by establishing a point at which the centerlines of the respective streets intersect and measuring from said point a distance of 110 feet along each centerline to a second point and connecting each such second point by a straight line. The area encompassed by the straight lines shall be the clear view area. It shall be unlawful to place or maintain within any clear view area any structures, signs, hedges, shrubbery, natural growth, berms, or mounds, or other obstructions to view at a height of between two and one-half and eight feet above the level of the street except for structures already in existence as of June 30, 1983. Exceptions shall be made for public utility poles, trees that are trimmed to the trunk at a height of two and one-half and eight feet above the level of the street whose trunk size does not constitute an obstruction of view, official traffic control devices, signs mounted eight feet or more above the level of the street that do not constitute an obstruction of view. \n\n(e)\nEvery such object or vegetation, as set forth above, is hereby declared a public nuisance, and will be abated or removed in accordance with the procedure outlined in chapter 8.22. In addition, such violations listed above, shall also be subject to other lawful remedies and actions legally afforded to the City of Reno. \n\n(Code 1966,  8.16.090; Ord. No. 3095,  1, 6-27-83; Ord.

No. 2710,  1, (8.20.100), 11-27-78) \n\nSec. 6.06.296. - Spectators prohibited at illegal speed contests or exhibitions of speed.\n\n(a)\nPreamble.\n\n(1)\nThe Reno City Council finds and declares that:\n\na.\nPursuant to Reno Municipal Code Section 6.06.295, motor vehicle speed contests and exhibitions of speed conducted on alleys, highways, roadways and streets are illegal. Motor vehicle speed contests and exhibitions of speed are more commonly known as street races or drag races and the incidences of such illegal races have been escalating over the past few years. \n\nb.\nStreet racing threatens the health and safety of the public, interferes with pedestrian and vehicular traffic, damages private property, creates a public nuisance and interferes with the right of private business owners to enjoy the use of their property within the City of Reno. \n\nc.\nIllegal street races occur on a regular basis on various streets within the City. Large numbers of racers and spectators gather on these streets late at night and in the early morning hours, blocking the streets and sidewalks to traffic, forming a racetrack area, placing bets, and otherwise encouraging, aiding and abetting the racing process. \n\nd.\nIllegal street races attract large numbers of spectators. The mere presence of spectators at these events fuels the illegal street racing and creates an environment in which these illegal activities can flourish. \n\n(2)\nThis ordinance is adopted to prohibit spectators at illegal street races with the aim of significantly curbing criminal activity. It targets a very clear, limited population and gives proper notice to citizens as to what activities are lawful and what activities are unlawful. In discouraging spectators, the act of organizing and participating in illegal street races will be discouraged. \n\n(b)\nDefinitions.\n\n(1)\n\"Illegal motor vehicle speed contest\" or \"illegal exhibition of speed\" means any speed contest or exhibition of speed referred to in Reno Municipal Code Section 6.06.295 \n\n(2)\n\"Preparations\" for an \"illegal motor vehicle speed contest\" or \"exhibition of speed\" include, but are not limited to, situations in which: \n\na.\nA group of motor vehicles or individuals has arrived at a location for the purpose of participating in or being spectators at the event; \n\nb.\nA group of individuals has lined one or both sides of a public street or highway for the purpose of participating in or being a spectator at the event; \n\nc.\nA group of individuals has gathered on private property open to the general public without the consent of the owner, operator, or agent thereof for the purpose of participating in or being a spectator at the event; \n\nd.\nOne or more individuals has impeded the free public use of a public street or highway by actions, words, or physical barriers for the purpose of conducting the event; \n\ne.\nTwo or more vehicles have lined up with motors running for an illegal motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition of speed;\n\nf.\nOne or more drivers is revving his engine or spinning his tires in preparation for the event; or\n\ng.\nAn individual is stationed at or near one or more motor vehicles serving as a race starter.\n\n(3)\nSpectator means any individual who is present at an illegal motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition of speed, or at a location where preparations are being made for such activities, for the purpose of viewing, observing, watching, or witnessing the event as it progresses. Spectator includes any individual at the location of the event without regard to whether the individual arrived at the event by driving a vehicle, riding as a passenger in a vehicle, walking, or arriving by some other means. \n\n(c)\nAny individual who is knowingly present as a spectator, either on a public street or highway, or on private property open to the general public without the consent of the owner, operator, or agent thereof, at an illegal motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition of speed is guilty of a misdemeanor. \n\n(d)\nAny individual who is knowingly present as a spectator, either on a public street or highway, or on private property open to the general public without the consent of the owner, operator, or agent thereof, where preparations are being made for an illegal motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition of speed is guilty of a misdemeanor. \n\n(e)\nAn individual is present at the illegal motor vehicle speed contest or exhibition of speed if that individual is within 200 feet of the location of the event, or within 200 feet of the location where preparations are being made for the event. \n\n(f)\nExemption: Nothing in this section prohibits law enforcement officers or their agents from being spectators at illegal motor vehicle speed contests or exhibitions of speed in the course of their official duties. \n\n(Ord. No. 5465,  1, 6-25-03) \n\nSec. 6.06.300. - Slower traffic to drive on right.\n\nIf any driver drives a motor vehicle at a speed so slow as to impede the forward movement of traffic proceeding immediately behind such vehicle, on any highway whereon a higher speed is lawful, the driver shall; when the width of the highway permits, drive to the extreme right side of the highway until such impeded traffic has passed by. \n\n(Code 1966,  8.20.050) \n\nState law reference- Similar provisions, NRS 484.373. \n\nSec. 6.06.305. - Regulation of speed by traffic signals.\n\nThe director of traffic and transportation is authorized to regulate the timing of traffic signals so as to permit the movement of traffic in an orderly and safe manner at speeds slightly at variance from the speeds otherwise applicable with the district or at intersections and may erect appropriate signs giving notice thereof. \n\n(Code 1966,  8.20.070) \n\nSec. 6.06.310. - Speed restrictions for solid rubber tire vehicles and for vehicles crossing bridges.\n\n(a)\nIt is unlawful for any person to drive any vehicle equipped with solid rubber or cushion tires to a speed greater than ten miles per hour. \n\n(b)\nIt is unlawful for any person to drive a vehicle over any bridge or other elevated structure constituting a part of a highway at a speed which is greater than the maximum speed which can be maintained with safety to such bridge or structure, when such structure is signposted as provided in this section. \n\n(c)\nUpon the trial of any person charged with violation of this section, proof of such determination of the maximum speed by and the existence of such signs shall constitute conclusive evidence of the maximum speed which can be maintained with safety to such bridge or structure. \n\n(Code 1966,  8.20.080) \n\nState law reference- Similar provisions, NRS 484.375. \n\nSec. 6.06.315. - School bus speed restriction.\n\n(a)\nA bus identified as, and meeting the requirements for, a school bus shall not exceed a speed of 50 miles per hour when transporting pupils to and from school. \n\n(b)\nA bus identified as, and meeting the requirements for, a school activity bus shall not exceed the maximum speed established by rules and regulations adopted by the state department of motor vehicles for such buses. \n\n(Code 1966,  8.20.090) \n\nState law reference- Similar provisions, NRS 484.365. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFOOTNOTE(S):\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(56) State Law reference- Similar provisions, NRS 484.361 et seq.

No. 3114,  1, 8-8-83) \n\nSec. 6.06.335. - Persons under the influence of intoxicating liquor or controlled substances; prohibitions, penalties, treatment programs.\n\n(a)\nIt is unlawful for any person who:\n\n(1)\nIs under the influence of intoxicating liquor;\n\n(2)\nHas 0.08 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood; or\n\n(3)\nIs found by measurement within two hours after driving or being in actual physical control of a vehicle to have 0.08 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood, to drive or be in actual physical control of any vehicle, or to ride any animal, within the city, on a street, highway, alley or premises to which the public has access. \n\n(b)\nIt is unlawful for any person who is an habitual user of or under the influence of any controlled substance, or who is under the combined influence of intoxicating liquor and a controlled substance, or any person who inhales, ingests, applies or otherwise uses any chemical, poison or organic solvent, or any compound or combination of any of these, to a degree which renders him incapable of safely driving or exercising actual physical control of a vehicle, to drive or be in actual physical control of a vehicle on a highway, street, or roadway within the city or on premises to which the public has access. The fact that any person charged with a violation of this subsection is or has been entitled to use that drug under the laws of the state is not a defense against any charge of violating this subsection. \n\n(c)\nIf a consumption is proved by a preponderance of the evidence, it is an affirmative defense under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) that the defendant consumed a sufficient quantity of alcohol after driving or being in actual physical control of the vehicle, and before his blood was tested, to cause the alcohol in his blood to equal or exceed 0.08 percent. A defendant who intends to offer this defense at trial must, not less than 14 days before the trial or hearing or at such other times the court may direct, file and serve on the prosecuting attorney a written notice of that intent. \n\n(Code 1966,  8.40.040; Ord.

Unless he is allowed to undergo treatment as provided in NRS 484.3794, the court shall: \n\n(a)\nExcept as otherwise provided in NRS 484.3792(6), order him to pay tuition for an education course on the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances approved by the department of motor vehicles and complete the course within the time specified in the order, and the court shall notify the department if he fails to complete the course within the specified time; \n\n(b)\nUnless the sentence is reduced pursuant to NRS 484.3794, sentence him to imprisonment for not less than two days nor more than six months in jail, or to perform 48 hours of work for the community while dressed in distinctive garb which identifies him as having violated the provisions of RMC 6.06.335; and \n\n(c)\nFine him not less than $200.00 nor more than $1,000.00.\n\n(2)\nFor a second offense within seven years, is guilty of a misdemeanor. The court:\n\n(a)\nShall sentence him to:\n\n1.\nImprisonment for not less than ten days nor more than six months in jail; or\n\n2.\nResidential confinement for not less than ten days nor more than six months, in the manner provided in NRS 5.0755 to 5.078, inclusive. \n\n(b)\nShall fine him not less than $500.00 nor more than $1,000.00; and\n\n(c)\nMay order him to attend a program of treatment for the abuse of alcohol or drugs pursuant to the provisions of NRS 484.37945. A person who wilfully fails or refuses to complete successfully a term of residential confinement or a program of treatment ordered pursuant to this paragraph is guilty of a misdemeanor. \n\n(b)\nAny offense which occurred within seven years immediately preceding the date of the principal offense or after the principal offense constitutes a prior offense for the purposes of this section when evidenced by a conviction, without regard to the sequence of the offenses and convictions. The facts concerning a prior offense must be alleged in the complaint, must not be proved at trial but must be proved at the time of sentencing. \n\n(c)\nNo person convicted of violating the provisions of RMC 6.06.335 may be released on probation, and no sentence imposed for violating those provisions may be suspended, except as provided in NRS 5.055 and NRS 484.3794, that portion of the sentence imposed that exceeds the mandatory minimum. No prosecuting attorney may dismiss a charge of violating the provisions of RMC 6.06.335 in exchange for plea of guilty of nolo contendere to a lesser charge or for any other reason unless he knows or it is obvious that the charge is not supported by probable cause or cannot be proved at the time of trial. \n\n(d)\nAny term of confinement imposed under the provisions of this section may be served intermittently at the discretion of the judge, except that a person who is convicted of a second or subsequent offense within seven years must be confined for at least one segment of not less than 48 consecutive hours. This discretion must be exercised after considering all the circumstances surrounding the offense, and the family and employment of the offender, but any sentence of 30 days or less must be served within six months from the date of conviction or, if the offender was sentenced pursuant to NRS 484.3794 and the suspension of his sentence was revoked, within six months after the date of revocation. Any segment of time for which the offender is confined must consist of not less than 24 consecutive hours. \n\n(e)\nJail sentences simultaneously imposed under this section and RMC 6.06.550(e) must run consecutively. \n\n(Ord.

Each such permit shall be valid only for a specifically prescribed vehicle. \n\n(j)\nEach resident shall receive one visitor pass at no additional charge. Violations in the use of the visitor pass will result in the revocation of such pass issued to the resident. \n\n(Ord. No. 3397,  1, 5-27-86; Ord. No. 5990,  1, 12-12-07) \n\nSec. 6.07.040. - Exceptions.\n\nThe parking prohibitions of this chapter shall not apply to clearly marked service or delivery vehicles which are being used to provide temporary services to or make immediate deliveries to residents of the permit parking district. \n\n(Ord.

A report of the findings, together with a recommendation, will be forwarded to the city manager within 60 days of receipt of the request. \n\n(c)\nIf the request is granted, the applicant shall pay the cost of signing the area in the amount in accordance with a set list of fees approved by the city council and kept on file in the office of the city engineer. Senior citizen applicants, said persons being over 65 years of age, shall pay signage costs at a reduced rate. Said signage fee will be in effect for one year, or until such time as an examination of the condition of the sign determines replacement is necessary. If so, the costs of replacement will be borne by the applicant. \n\n(d)\nDisabled residents issued a parking permit or license plate by the Nevada State Department of Motor Vehicles and Public Safety pursuant to NRS 482.384 or NRS 482.377 will be given special considerations if existing off-street parking can not be accessed by the resident. \n\n(e)\nIf two off-street parking spaces exist, such as garage space and/or driveway space long enough to accommodate a vehicle, no \"resident parking only\" spaces will be granted, unless otherwise provided in subsection (d). \n\n(f)\nIf one off-street space or less is provided, \"resident parking only\" zones may be considered, if over a five-day period the public works department determines that a \"resident parking only\" zone is in the best interest of the area residents and fulfills the requirements of the other parameters of this section. \n\n(g)\nControlled parking/access streets will not be considered for \"resident parking only\" zones.\n\n(h)\nThe public works department will review existing and future \"resident parking only\" locations every five years, at which time a new engineering study will be performed to determine requisite compliance. \n\n(i)\nThe public works department reserves the right to discontinue any and all \"resident parking only\" zone permits, if it is determined that any of the following conditions exist: \n\n(1)\nThe applicant vacated the residence;\n\n(2)\nThe zone no longer qualifies under any and all subsections (b) through (l);\n\n(3)\nThe continued use of the zone is determined to be unsafe or the street classification changes by engineering study.\n\n(j)\nIf the zone is discontinued, a financial reimbursement will be made by the city on a prorated basis. Discontinuance must be accompanied by a 30-day written notice by either party. \n\n(k)\nThe city council may waive any or all of the signing fee for any applicant upon a finding of special circumstances.\n\n(l)\nA residential parking permit issued under this section shall be limited to single-family residences only, except permits approved by the city manager prior to date of adoption. \n\n(Ord.

No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.030. - Notice of infraction-Form.\n\nThe notice of infraction must be on the form which is prescribed by the public works department and must contain the following information: \n\n(1)\nThe state and license number and make of the vehicle which is parked in violation of the provisions of this Code;\n\n(2)\nThe location at which the violation occurred;\n\n(3)\nThe date and time of the violation;\n\n(4)\nThe number of the parking meter which is adjacent to the vehicle, or the parking space number, if the vehicle is violating a parking regulation respecting the use of parking meters, as provided for in Chapter 6.08 of this Code; \n\n(5)\nThe signature of the person who issues the notice of infraction;\n\n(6)\nThe section of this Code which allegedly is being violated;\n\n(7)\nInformation which advises of the manner in which, and the time within which, the notice of infraction should be answered;\n\n(8)\nA warning that repeated violations may result in the impounding or immobilizing of vehicle;\n\n(9)\nAny other reasonable information which is prescribed by the public works department.\n\n\n(Ord.

No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.050. - Same-Filing.\n\nThe original notice of infraction, or a facsimile thereof, must be filed with the Reno City Clerk and retained by the Reno City Clerk and is deemed to be a public record of matters which are observed pursuant to a duty which is imposed by law and is prima facie evidence of the facts which are alleged therein. A duplicate of the notice of infraction must be served on the person to whom it is issued as provided in section 6.30.060. \n\n(Ord. No. 4054,  1, 2-12-91; Ord. No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.060. - Same-Service.\n\n(a)\nThe notice of infraction must be served upon the owner and/or operator of the vehicle by affixing the notice to the vehicle in a conspicuous place. Service of the notice of infraction by affixation has the same force and effect and is subject to the same penalties for the disregard thereof, as if the notice of infraction were personally served on the owner and/or operator of the vehicle. In lieu of service by affixation, the notice of infraction may be personally served upon the owner and/or operator of the vehicle. \n\n(b)\nFor the purposes of this chapter, an operator of a vehicle who is not the owner thereof but who uses or operates the vehicle with the permission of the owner, express or implied, is deemed to be the agent of the owner to receive a notice of infraction, whether it is personally served on the operator or served by affixation, and service in either manner is also deemed to be lawful service upon the owner. \n\n(Ord. No. 4054,  1, 2-12-91; Ord. No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.070. - Liability.\n\nThe operator of a vehicle is liable for the civil fines which are imposed pursuant to this chapter. The registered owner of the vehicle, even if he is not the operator thereof, is also liable for such civil fines, unless he is able to demonstrate that the vehicle was used without his permission, express or implied. A registered owner who pays any civil fine pursuant to this chapter has the right to recover from the operator of the vehicle the civil fines so paid, and has a cause of action in any court which has appropriate jurisdiction against the operator of the vehicle for the amount so paid. \n\n(Ord. No. 4054,  1, 2-12-91; Ord. No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.080. - Notice of infraction-Duties of respondent.\n\n(a)\nA person who responds to a notice of infraction must:\n\n(1)\n\"Admit\" the commission of the infraction and pay the appropriate civil fine.\n\n(2)\n\"Deny\" liability for the infraction.\n\n(b)\nThe burden to prove any defense shall be upon the person raising such defense.\n\n(c)\nA person may \"admit\" pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section by paying the amount of the civil fine which is appropriate for the violation which has committed to the Reno City Clerk. \n\n(d)\nA person may \"deny\" liability pursuant to paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this Section only by appearing in person before the Reno City Clerk at which time a date for a hearing on the infraction shall be scheduled by the Reno City Clerk. \n\n(e)\nIf the hearing officer finds that the infraction has not occurred or an infraction has been committed but one or more of the defenses set forth below is applicable, the hearing officer may dismiss the notice of infraction and release the registered owner and/or operator from liability thereunder. Such defenses include, but are not limited to: \n\n(1)\nAt the time of the receipt of the notice, possession of the subject vehicle had been acquired in violation of the criminal laws of the State of Nevada. \n\n(2)\nIf the notice of authorized use alleges a violation of any ordinance pertaining to a parking meter, such meter was mechanically malfunctioning to the extent that its reliability is questionable. \n\n(3)\nCompliance with the subject ordinances would have presented an imminent and irreparable injury to persons or property.\n\n(4)\nIn cases in which the provisions of RMC 6.06.070(b) are found to apply. \n\n(f)\nIf the hearing officer finds that the infraction has been committed, but the subject vehicle was mechanically incapable of being moved from such location for a period less than six hours, the hearing officer may reduce the civil fine associated therewith, but in no event shall such civil fines be reduced below the sum of $5.00. \n\n(g)\nIf the hearing officer finds that an infraction has been committed and no applicable defense exists, the hearing officer may, in the interest of justice and on behalf of the city, enter into an agreement for the timely or periodic payment of the applicable penalty. \n\n(h)\n(1) In a contested citation proceeding, a party against whom the hearing officer has entered a finding of liability and assessment of fine, by default or otherwise may, if the assessed fine has been paid, appeal to the Reno Municipal Court within ten days from the date of entry of the finding and assessment. Appeal shall be made by filing with the Reno City Clerk a written notice containing the appellant's name, current address, phone number, citation number, and a statement that the appellant appeals the finding and assessment. \n\n(2)\nUpon receipt of timely notice of appeal, the city clerk shall forward the notice, together with a copy of the citation and a copy of the hearing officer's finding and assessment to the Reno Municipal Court and a copy of the same to the office of the city attorney. \n\n(3)\nOn appeal, the matter shall be resolved in a civil action, except that no formal complaint need be filed nor summons issued. The proceedings shall be governed by section 6.30.110 of this chapter. The filing of the notice of appeal shall constitute a submission by the appellant to the jurisdiction of the Reno Municipal Court and to all notices and orders issued by said court during appeal, and to final judgment of said court on resolution of the appeal. \n\n(Ord. No. 4054,  1, 2-12-91; Ord. No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.090. - Same-Judicial enforcement.\n\nJudicial enforcement of notices of infraction must be by way of civil suit in the Reno Municipal Court. A certified copy of the notice of infraction constitutes a prima facie showing that an infraction occurred. \n\n(Ord. No. 4054,  1, 2-12-91; Ord. No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.100. - Commencement of civil action-Procedure.\n\nThe action may be commenced at any time after the expiration of 40 days following the date on which the notice of infraction was served pursuant to section 6.30.110, by the filing of a complaint in the name of the City of Reno and the issuance of a summons with respect thereto, and service of such complaint and summons on the defendant must be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the registered owner of the vehicle at his last known address, as indicated by the vehicle registration which is maintained by the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles or in any other manner which is authorized by law. The proceedings in Reno Municipal Court for actions commenced pursuant this chapter shall be governed by Rules 1 and 3 through 87 of the Justice Court Rules of Procedure. \n\n(Ord. No. 4054,  1, 2-12-91; Ord. No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.110. - Same-Time limit.\n\nCivil actions pursuant to this chapter may only be commenced within two years after the date on which the infraction occurred, except as provided in section 6.30.610, and the standard of proof which is applied is the preponderance of the evidence. The city has satisfied its burden of proof if it shows that an infraction occurred and that the vehicle was registered to the defendant on the date on which the infraction occurred, unless either of these elements is satisfactorily rebutted by the defendant. The defendant may assert the defenses set forth in section 6.30.080(e) and (f), and the court may dismiss the notice of the infraction if it finds the defenses set forth in section 6.30.080(e) are applicable and may reduce the fine if the court finds that the defenses set forth in section 6.30.080(f) are applicable. \n\n(Ord. No. 4054,  1, 2-12-91; Ord. No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.120. - Monetary sanctions for parking violations-Not exclusive.\n\nThe enforcement of parking (non-moving traffic) laws under this chapter is not exclusive and shall not prevent the institution and the prosecution of criminal proceedings in the Reno Municipal Court against the registered owner and/or operator of such vehicle, who has been served with six or more infractions to which the registered owner and/or operator of such vehicle has not responded. \n\n(Ord. No. 4054,  1, 2-12-91; Ord. No. 6194,  1, 7-6-11) \n\nSec. 6.30.130. - Stopping or standing prohibited generally.\n\n(a)\nA person shall not stop, stand or park a vehicle, except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or in compliance with law or the directions of a police officer, or official traffic-control device in any of the following places: \n\n(1)\nOn a sidewalk or parkway;\n\n(2)\nIn front of a public or private driveway;\n\n(3)\nWithin an intersection;\n\n(4)\nWithin 15 feet of a fire hydrant;\n\n(5)\nOn a crosswalk;\n\n(6)\nWithin 20 feet of a crosswalk;\n\n(7)\nWithin 30 feet upon the approach to any official traffic-control signal located at the side of a highway;\n\n(8)\nBetween a safety zone and the adjacent curb or within 30 feet of points on the curb immediately opposite the ends of a safety zone; \n\n(9)\nWithin 50 feet of the nearest rail of a railroad except in an authorized parking area or other area designated by the traffic engineer or designee; \n\n(10)\nWithin 20 feet of a driveway entrance to any fire station and, on the side of a highway opposite the entrance to any fire station, within 75 feet of such entrance; \n\n(11)\nAlongside or opposite any highway excavation or obstruction when such stopping, standing or parking would obstruct traffic;\n\n(12)\nAlongside of any vehicle proceeding in the opposite direction for purposes of conversing with the driver or passengers of that vehicle; \n\n(13)\nUpon any bridge or other elevated structure or within a highway tunnel, except in an authorized parking area or other area designated by the traffic engineer or designee; \n\n(14)\nWithin five feet of a public or private driveway;\n\n(15)\nAt any place where official traffic-control devices prohibit stopping, standing or parking; and\n\n(16)\nOn the highway side of any vehicle stopped or parked at the edge of or curb of a highway.\n\n(b)\nA person shall not move a vehicle not owned by such person into any such prohibited area or away from a curb such distance as is unlawful. \n\n(c)\nIt is unlawful for the owner or driver of any vehicle or trailer or commercial motor vehicle, as defined in RMC 6.04.110, with or without towed units, having an overall length of more than 24 feet to stand or park the same within District No. 1 at any time except with a permit issued in accordance with RMC Chapter 6.11; provided, however, that a vehicle carrying passengers may stop for the purpose of picking up or discharging passengers at designated bus stops. \n\n(d)\nIt is unlawful for the owner or driver of any vehicle or trailer or commercial motor vehicle, as defined in RMC 6.04.110, with or without towed units, having an overall length of more than 24 feet or a height of more than eight feet or a width of more than eight feet exclusive of side-view mirrors to stand or park the same at any time on any street or highway or alley except while such vehicle is picking up or discharging passengers. \n\n(1)\nThe owner or driver of a recreational vehicle may stand or park the recreational vehicle immediately in front of the real property of the owner or driver of the recreational vehicle for the purpose of picking up or discharging passengers or preparing the recreational vehicle for use or storage in a lawful manner. For purposes of the subsection, a motor vehicle is defined as a vehicular-type unit primarily designed as temporary living quarters for travel, recreational or camping use, which may be self propelled or mounted upon or drawn by a motor vehicle. \n\n(2)\nNo motor vehicle and/or trailer shall remain standing or parked for a period of more than 48 consecutive hours.\n\n(3)\nFor the purposes of this section, a vehicle and/or trailer or commercial motor vehicle, as defined in RMC 6.04.110, with or without towed units, not otherwise prohibited in subsection (d) shall be considered to have been parked or left standing for 48 consecutive hours if it has not been moved at least one mile during the 48-hour period.

The customer information must be provided in a format the alarm company is capable of producing and must include the following: \n\na.\nCustomer name;\n\nb.\nCustomer billing address;\n\nc.\nCustomer telephone number;\n\nd.\nAlarm site address; and\n\ne.\nAlarm company license number.\n\n(11)\nPurchased accounts.\nAn alarm installation company or monitoring company that purchases any alarm system account from another company shall notify the alarm administrator of such purchase and shall provide to the alarm administrator, within 30 days from the date of acquisition, a complete list of the acquired customers, in a format the alarm company is capable of producing, that includes the following: \n\na.\nCustomer name;\n\nb.\nCustomer billing address;\n\nc.\nCustomer telephone number;\n\nd.\nAlarm site address; and\n\ne.\nAlarm company license number.\n\n(12)\nThe customer lists described in subsections (9) and (10) above are proprietary and confidential information and will not be released to anyone absent a court order. \n\n(13)\nFailure to provide customer lists to the alarm administrator, as required in subsections (9) and (10) above, will result in a fine of $50.00 per working day until the alarm installation company or monitoring company complies with the requirement. Failure to comply after ten working days will result in the suspension of the company's security alarm license. \n\n(14)\nAlarm installation companies or alarm monitoring companies whose security alarm licenses have been suspended as a result of violations of the duties specified in this subsection may seek reinstatement upon compliance with the requirements herein. The city will assess reinstatement fees, if users have been notified of the suspension in accordance with subsection j(4) below. \n\n(j)\nSpecial licensing of alarm installation and monitoring companies.\n\n(1)\nEvery alarm installation company and every alarm monitoring company shall obtain a City of Reno security alarm license from the police department and pay an annual fee to the City of Reno. Failure to pay the annual fee within 30 days after notice requires the payment of a late fee. \n\n(2)\nThe police department will not respond to any alarm dispatch request from any alarm installation company or monitoring company that does not possess a current, valid security alarm license issued pursuant to this section and a current, valid City of Reno business license. \n\n(3)\nThe alarm administrator shall notify all known alarm users subscribing to an unlicensed alarm installation company or an unlicensed alarm monitoring company that the company is unlicensed and that the police department will no longer respond to the user's alarms. \n\n(4)\nThe fee imposed by this section is in addition to the business license fee and all other fees levied by the City.\n\n(k)\nDuties and authority of the alarm administrator.\n\n(1)\nThe alarm administrator shall:\n\na.\nDesignate the manner and form of alarm dispatch requests and the telephone numbers to be used for such requests; and\n\nb.\nEstablish a procedure to accept cancellation of alarm dispatch requests.\n\n(2)\nThe alarm administrator shall establish a procedure to acquire and record information on alarm dispatch requests including the following information: \n\na.\nIdentification of the alarm site;\n\nb.\nThe date and time alarm dispatch request was received, including the name of the monitoring company and the monitoring operator's name or number; \n\nc.\nDate and time of an officer's arrival at the alarm site;\n\nd.\nThe alarm zone and zone description, if available;\n\ne.\nName of alarm user's personal representative present at the alarm site, if any;\n\nf.\nWhether an officer was unable to locate the address of the alarm site; and\n\ng.\nThe cause of the alarm signal, if known.\n\n(3)\nThe alarm administrator shall establish and implement a procedure to notify the alarm user of a false alarm. The notice shall include the following: \n\na.\nThe date and time of an officer's response to the false alarm; and\n\nb.\nA statement urging the alarm user to ensure that the alarm system is properly operated, inspected, and serviced in order to avoid false alarms and resulting false alarm fees. \n\nc.\nThe false alarm fees recorded.\n\n(4)\nThe alarm administrator may require that a conference be held with an alarm user and the alarm installation company or monitoring company responsible for repairing or monitoring of the alarm system to review the circumstances of each false alarm. The conference may be held in person or through a conference telephone call, at the alarm administrator's discretion. Failure to participate will result in suspension of either the alarm permit, the security alarm license, or both as indicated by the facts of the case. Reinstatement after compliance will require payment of an additional permit fee for the alarm user or will be under the terms of subsection (i)(14) for alarm installation companies and monitoring companies. \n\n(5)\nThe alarm administrator may establish an alarm user awareness class. The alarm administrator may request the assistance of associations, alarm companies and law enforcement agencies in developing and implementing the class. The class shall inform alarm users of the problems created by false alarms and teach alarm users how to avoid creating false alarms. \n\n(6)\nIf a false holdup alarm has occurred and the alarm was triggered using a single action, non-recessed button, the alarm administrator may consider a waiver of the false alarm fee if action is taken by the alarm user to remove or replace the single action, non-recessed button. \n\n(7)\nThe alarm administrator will make a copy of this ordinance and/or an ordinance summary sheet available to each alarm user.\n\n(l)\nFalse alarm fees.\n\n(1)\nFalse alarm fees.\nAn alarm user shall pay fees to the alarm administrator for police response to any false alarm. The fees charged pursuant to this title shall be contained in the fee schedule which shall be maintained by the police department, and amended upon approval of the city council. \n\n(2)\nIf a false alarm fee is not paid within 30 days after the invoice is mailed, a late fee will be imposed.\n\n(3)\nFees for false alarms by unregistered alarm systems.\nIn addition to the fees set forth in subsections (1) and (2), a supplemental fee is hereby imposed upon any person operating an unregistered alarm system. The alarm administrator may waive this additional fee for an unregistered system if the alarm user submits an application for alarm registration within ten business days after receiving notice of such violation. \n\n(4)\nIf cancellation of police response occurs prior to the police officer being dispatched, the response is not considered a false alarm for the purpose of fees, and no penalty will be assessed. \n\n(5)\nThe alarm administrator may waive a false alarm fee due to a history of false alarms that is identified as chronic equipment failure. \n\n(6)\nThe alarm installation company shall be assessed a fee if the officer responding to the false alarm determines that an on-site employee of the alarm installation company directly caused the false alarm. Such false alarms are not included in the total number of false alarms for the alarm user. \n\n(7)\nA fee is hereby imposed against any monitoring company that fails to verify alarm system signals as required in subsection (i)(9)(b). \n\n(8)\nA fine in the amount of $200.00 is hereby imposed against an alarm installation company if the alarm administrator determines that an employee of the alarm installation company knowingly made a false statement concerning the inspection of an alarm site or the performance of an alarm system. \n\n(9)\nNotice of the right of appeal under this ordinance will be included with notice of any penalty.\n\n(m)\nNotice to alarm users of false alarms and suspension of police response.\n\n(1)\nThe alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user in writing after each false alarm. The notice shall include the amount of the fee for the false alarm, the fact that response will be suspended after the third false alarm during the permit year, (excluding duress, holdup and panic alarms) and a description of the appeals procedure available to the alarm user. \n\n(2)\nThe alarm administrator shall notify the alarm user and the alarm installation company or monitoring company in writing 30 days before an alarm response is to be suspended. Suspension of alarm response does not apply to duress, robbery, holdup and panic alarms. The notice of suspension must also include the amount of the fine for each false alarm and a description of the appeals procedure available to the alarm user and the alarm installation company or monitoring company. \n\n(n)\nViolation to make alarm dispatch request for suspended alarm site.\n\n(1)\nThe alarm administrator shall notify the police department of each alarm user whose intrusion alarm permit qualifies for suspension under this section. The alarm administrator shall suspend an intrusion alarm permit if it is determined that: \n\na.\nThe alarm user has had three or more false intrusion alarms within one year after the date of issuance of their annual permit, except that the alarm administrator may waive a suspension of a permit upon receipt of documented work orders showing reasonable attempts to repair the alarm system. The alarm administrator may impose a one week acclimation period upon reinstatement of the permit. \n\nb.\nThere is a false statement of a material fact in the application for a permit; or\n\nc.\nThe alarm user fails or refuses to pay a false alarm fee or late fee assessed under this section.\n\n(2)\nIt is a violation of this section for a person to operate an intrusion alarm system during the period in which the alarm permit is suspended. It is a violation of this section for a monitoring company to make an alarm dispatch request to an intrusion alarm site after the company has been notified by the alarm administrator that the permit for that alarm site has been suspended. The monitoring company must pay a $50.00 fine to the alarm administrator for each such dispatch to an alarm site. If the penalty is not paid to the alarm administrator within 30 days, a late fee is hereby imposed on the monitoring company. \n\n(3)\nUnless there is a separate indication that there is a crime in progress, Emergency Communications shall not dispatch an officer to an intrusion alarm site for which the alarm permit is suspended. \n\n(4)\nIf an intrusion alarm permit is reinstated, the police department may again suspend the permit if it is determined that two false alarms have occurred within 180 days after the reinstatement date. The exception set forth in paragraph (n)(1)(a) applies to any such suspension. \n\n(5)\nThis subsection applies only to intrusion alarm systems. Holdup alarms, robbery alarms and panic alarms are not subject to suspension. \n\n(o)\nAppeals of determinations regarding alarm permits and fees.\n\n(1)\nIf the alarm administrator assesses a fee, suspends an alarm permit or denies the issuance, renewal or reinstatement of an alarm permit, the alarm administrator shall send written notice of the action and a statement of the right to appeal to the affected applicant or alarm user and the alarm installation company or monitoring company. \n\n(2)\nThe alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm monitoring company may appeal any action described in (1) above to the chief of police or designee by setting forth in writing the reasons for the appeal and delivering the appeal to the chief of police or designee within 20 business days after receipt of notice of the action. Failure to deliver the appeal within that time period is a waiver of the right to appeal. \n\n(3)\nThe procedure for an appeal to the chief of police or designee is as follows:\n\na.\nThe applicant, alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring company may file a written request for appeal by paying an appeal fee to the police department and setting forth the reasons for the appeal. The appeal must be entitled \"Appeal from Alarm Administrator's Action.\" Appeal fees will be returned to the appealing party if the appeal is successful. Upon good cause shown, the alarm administrator may, in the exercise of discretion, waive the appeal fee for residential alarm users. \n\nb.\nThe chief of police or designee shall conduct a recorded hearing within 30 days after receipt of the request for review and shall consider the evidence submitted by the appealing party and the alarm administrator. The chief of police or designee must base the decision on the preponderance of evidence presented at the hearing and must render a decision within 15 days after the date of the hearing. The decision shall affirm or reverse the decision or action taken by the alarm administrator. \n\nc.\nAny person aggrieved by the decision of the chief of police or designee may appeal in accordance with the procedure set forth in Reno Municipal Code 1.05.500, et seq. \n\nd.\nFiling of an appeal stays any action by the alarm administrator to suspend an alarm permit or require the payment of a fee or penalty until the appeal process has been exhausted. This provision applies only to the action of the alarm administrator that is the subject of the appeal. This provision does not operate as a bar to enforcement action on violations of this section that occur thereafter. \n\n(4)\nThe alarm administrator or the chief of police, or their respective designees, may adjust the count of false alarms based on: \n\na.\nEvidence that a false alarm was caused by action of the telephone company;\n\nb.\nEvidence that a false alarm was caused by a power outage;\n\nc.\nEvidence that an alarm dispatch request was not a false alarm; or\n\nd.\nThe occurrence of multiple alarms within in a 24-hour period, which may be considered as one false alarm to allow the alarm user time to take corrective action, unless the false alarms are directly caused by the alarm user. \n\ne.\nOn review of fees or penalties assessed to an alarm installation company or monitoring company, the alarm administrator, or, if appealed, chief of police, or designee, or the administrative hearing officer, may consider whether the alarm or monitoring company has engaged in a consistent pattern of violations. \n\n(p)\nReinstatement of suspended alarm permits.\n\n(1)\nOn the first suspension of a permit, a person whose alarm permit has been suspended may obtain reinstatement of the permit by the alarm administrator if the person: \n\na.\nSubmits a new application and pays a reinstatement fee;\n\nb.\nPays, or otherwise resolves, all outstanding fees and penalties;\n\nc.\nSubmits a certification from an alarm installation company stating that the alarm system has been inspected and repaired (if necessary) by the alarm installation company; and \n\nd.\nThe alarm user successfully completes an on-line alarm awareness class and test.\n\n(2)\nOn the second and every subsequent suspension of a permit, reinstatement may be obtained by compliance with (1) above and compliance with any of the following conditions that the alarm administrator may require: \n\na.\nProof that an employee of the alarm installation company or monitoring company caused the false alarm.\n\nb.\nUpgrade the alarm control panel to meet SIA Control Panel Standard CP-01.\n\nc.\nA written statement from an independent inspector designated by the chief of police or designee that the alarm system has been inspected and is in good working order. \n\nd.\nConfirmation that all motion detectors are \"dual technology\" type.\n\ne.\nConfirmation that the alarm system requires two independent zones to trigger before transmitting an alarm signal to the monitoring company. \n\nf.\nConfirmation that the alarm system requires two independent detectors to trigger before transmitting an alarm signal to the monitoring company. \n\ng.\nCertification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a listen-in device. This condition does not apply to residential property. \n\nh.\nCertification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a camera device. This condition does not apply to residential property. \n\ni.\nCertification that the monitoring company will not make an alarm dispatch request unless the need for an officer is confirmed by a person at the alarm site. \n\nj.\nThe alarm user successfully completes an on-line alarm awareness class and test.\n\n(3)\nThe police department shall reinstate its response to an intrusion alarm site as soon as is practicable after receiving notice of reinstatement from the alarm administrator. \n\n(q)\nRevocation of alarm permit.\n\n(1)\nThe chief of police or designee may revoke an alarm permit if it is determined that:\n\na.\nThere is a violation of this chapter by the alarm user;\n\nb.\nThere is a false statement of a material fact in the application for a permit;\n\nc.\nThe permitted alarm system has generated more than 12 false alarms during any 12 month period; or\n\nd.\nThe alarm user has failed to pay an alarm permit fee or late fee, a late renewal fee or any fee or penalty assessed under this section, more than 30 days after the fee is due. \n\n(2)\nA revocation made pursuant to this section is not subject to administrative review.\n\n(3)\nThe chief of police or designee may, for good cause shown, reinstate a permit that has been revoked pursuant to this section.\n\n(r)\nPolice department response.\nThe police department will respond to all \"in progress\" robbery or panic alarms as promptly as possible, taking into account pending calls for service, following notification of the receipt of the alarm from the alarm or monitoring company. \n\n(s)\nConfidentiality of alarm information.\nAll information contained in documents gathered through alarm registrations, the submission of customer lists and in the alarm appeal process must be held in confidence by all employees of the alarm administrator and the City of Reno. Such information is proprietary and is hereby declared confidential and not a public record. Absent special circumstances, such information must not be released to the public or any person other than a law enforcement agency or the applicable alarm user, alarm installation company or alarm monitoring company except pursuant to court order. \n\n(t)\nScope of police duty; immunities preserved.\nThe issuance of alarm permits does not create a contract between the police department and/or the city and any alarm user, alarm installation company or monitoring company, nor does it create a duty or obligation, either expressed or implied, on the police department to respond to any alarm. Any and all liability and consequential damage resulting from the failure of the police department to respond to an alarm dispatch request is hereby disclaimed and full governmental immunity as provided by law is retained. By applying for an alarm permit, the alarm user acknowledges that the police department response is influenced by the availability of officers, priority of calls, traffic conditions, emergency condition and staffing levels. \n\n(Ord.

If the peace officer determines that one of the persons who allegedly committed a battery was the primary physical aggressor involved in the incident, the peace officer is not required to arrest any other person believed to have committed a battery during the incident. In determining whether a person is a primary physical aggressor for the purposes of this subsection, the peace officer shall consider: \n\n(1)\nPrior domestic violence involving either person;\n\n(2)\nThe relative severity of the injuries inflicted upon the persons involved;\n\n(3)\nThe potential for future injury;\n\n(4)\nWhether one of the alleged batteries was committed in self-defense; and\n\n(5)\nAny other factor that may help the peace officer decide which person was the primary physical aggressor.\n\n(d)\nA peace officer shall not base his decision regarding whether to arrest a person pursuant to this section on his perception of the willingness of a victim or a witness to the incident to testify or otherwise participate in related judicial proceedings. \n\n(e)\nWhen a peace officer investigates such a battery, whether or not an arrest is made, he shall prepare and submit a written report of the alleged battery to his supervisor and other person designated by his employer to receive reports regarding similar allegations.

For purposes of this section, \"entrance\" means the entire area between the outer edge of an entrance to a building and the exterior door, and includes the entry way, doorway or vestibule. \n\n(b)\nThe prohibition contained in this section shall not apply to any person sitting or lying down in any entrance to a building due to a medical emergency. \n\n(c)\nAny person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(Ord. No. 5850,  1, 6-28-06) \n\nSec. 8.12.015. - Sitting or lying down on public sidewalks in the Downtown Reno Regional Center.\n\n(a)\nPreamble. The Reno City Council finds and declares as follows:\n\n(1)\nPublic sidewalks in the Downtown Reno Regional Center are created and maintained for the primary purposes of enabling pedestrians to safely and efficiently move about from place to place, facilitating deliveries of goods and services, and providing convenient access to entertainment, goods and services. \n\n(2)\nThe public sidewalks in the Downtown Reno Regional Center are prone to congestion, and should be kept available to serve these primary purposes. \n\n(3)\nExcept in places provided therefor or where necessary, sitting or lying on the public sidewalks in the Downtown Reno Regional Center interferes with the primary purposes of the public sidewalks, threatens public safety and damages the public welfare. \n\n(4)\nPedestrians, particularly the elderly, disabled, or vision impaired are put at increased risk when they must see and navigate around individuals sitting or lying upon the public sidewalk. \n\n(5)\nThe public welfare is promoted by an economically healthy downtown area which attracts people to shop, recreate, work and be entertained. These areas provide easily accessible goods and services, employment opportunities, the tax revenues necessary to support essential public services, and economic productivity necessary to maintain and improve property within these areas. \n\n(6)\nIn some circumstances people sitting or lying on the sidewalks deter many members of the public from frequenting the downtown area, which contributes to undermining the essential economic vitality of this area. Business failures and relocations can cause vacant buildings which contribute to a spiral of deterioration and blight which harms the public health, safety and welfare. An important factor in protecting public safety is attracting people to the streets and sidewalks of the city's Downtown Reno Regional Center, because the presence of many law abiding citizens serves as a deterrent to crime and increases the public's sense of security and the safety of all. \n\n(7)\nThere are numerous other places within the Downtown Reno Regional Center and adjacent areas where sitting or lying down can be accommodated without unduly interfering with the safe flow of pedestrian traffic, impairing commercial activity, threatening public safety or harming the public welfare. The limited regulation of sitting or lying down on sidewalks is both reasonably necessary and appropriately balances the public interest and individual rights. \n\n(b)\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, no person shall sit or lie down upon a public sidewalk, or upon a blanket, chair, stool, or any other object placed upon a public sidewalk in the Downtown Reno Regional Center, as it is defined in section 18.08.101(i)(1)(b) and (c) of the Reno Municipal Code. \n\n(c)\nThe prohibition in subsection (b) shall not apply to any person:\n\n(1)\nSitting or lying down on a public sidewalk due to a medical emergency;\n\n(2)\nWho, as the result of a disability, utilizes a wheelchair, walker or similar device to move about the public sidewalk;\n\n(3)\nOperating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to a street use permit; or a person participating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally, demonstration, meeting, or similar event conducted on the public sidewalk pursuant to a street use or other applicable permit. \n\n(4)\nSitting on a chair or bench located on the public sidewalk which is supplied by a public agency or by the abutting private property owner; or \n\n(5)\nSitting on a public sidewalk with a bus stop zone while waiting for public or private transportation.\n\nNothing in any of these exceptions shall be construed to permit any conduct which is prohibited by section 8.12.042 of the Reno Municipal Code (blocking of sidewalks). \n\n(d)\nNo person shall be charged with a violation of this section unless the person engages in conduct prohibited by this section after having been notified by a law enforcement officer that the conduct violates this section. \n\n(e)\nThe provisions of this section are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this section, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this section, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances. \n\n(f)\nAny person who violates this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(Ord.

This section shall not apply to urinating or defecating in any restroom or other facility designed for the sanitary disposal of human waste. \n\n(b)\nAny person convicted under this section shall be punished for a misdemeanor.\n\n(Ord. No. 4607,  1, 3-26-96) \n\nSec. 8.12.020. - Disturbing the peace.\n\nIt is unlawful for any person to commit a breach of the peace. Such breach shall consist of: \n\na.\nFighting or challenging to fight; or\n\nb.\nConduct or words calculated to provoke violence or a violation of the law by the person to whom the conduct or words are addressed; or \n\nc.\nMaking annoying, lewd, malicious or threatening telephone calls; or\n\nd.\nWillfully and unreasonably subjecting a person or neighborhood to any noise which is likely to disturb the peace of persons of reasonable and ordinary sensibilities. \n\n\n(Code 1966,  11.12.090; Ord.

No. 5605,  1, 10-13-04) \n\nSec. 8.12.030. - Camping on public property in the Truckee River Corridor.\n\n(a)\nPreamble. The Reno City Council finds and declares as follows: \n\n(1)\nThe Truckee River runs from the outlet of Lake Tahoe, through Truckee and directly through downtown Reno on its way to Pyramid Lake, and is an important natural resource shared by our city and surrounding communities. \n\n(2)\nThe Truckee River watershed includes all of the land draining into the river, either directly, through our urban storm water system, or into creeks which feed the Truckee River. \n\n(3)\nOnce a thriving, wild waterway with hundreds of bird species and 40-pound Lahontan cutthroat trout, the Truckee has been highly degraded over the past century. \n\n(4)\nProper management of the Truckee River, which provides 85 percent of the water delivered in the Truckee Meadows, is vital to sustaining a healthy community. \n\n(5)\nUnregulated camping in and around the Truckee River threatens to pollute the area's primary source of drinking water, and detracts from the scenic beauty of the river. \n\n(6)\nLimited regulation of camping within the Truckee River Corridor is reasonably necessary to protect and enhance water quality or water resources of the Truckee River and appropriately balances the public interest and individual rights. \n\n(b)\nUnless a permit is obtained in accordance with section 8.23.075 or other applicable provision of the Reno Municipal Code, it shall be unlawful to camp on public property within 350 feet of the shore of the Truckee River within city limits (the \"Truckee River Corridor\"). For the purpose of this section, \"to camp\" or \"camping\" means to use real property of the city for overnight living accommodation purposes such as: \n\n(1)\nSleeping activities or making preparations to sleep including the laying down of bedding for the purpose of sleeping;\n\n(2)\nStoring personal belongings;\n\n(3)\nMaking any fire, other than in a fire or barbecue pit provided or area designated for such use by the city or portable propane grill used according to manufacturer's instructions; \n\n(4)\nUsing any tent, shelter, other structure or vehicle for sleeping; or\n\n(5)\nCooking, other than in a fire or barbecue pit provided or area designated for such use by the city or portable propane grill used according to manufacturer's instructions. \n\nFor purposes of this section, \"overnight\" is defined as the period from one-half hour after sunset to sunrise. \n\nThe above listed activities constitute camping when it reasonably appears in light of all the circumstances that the participant, in conducting these activities is in fact using the area for overnight living accommodation purposes, regardless of the intent of the participant or the nature of any other activities in which they may also be engaging. \n\n(c)\nThe prohibition in subsection (b) shall not apply to any person:\n\n(1)\nSitting or lying down on public property due to a medical emergency;\n\n(2)\nWho, as the result of a disability, utilizes a wheelchair, walker or similar device to move about the public property;\n\n(3)\nOperating or patronizing a commercial establishment conducted on the public property pursuant to an applicable permit;\n\n(4)\nParticipating in or attending a parade, festival, performance, rally, demonstration, meeting, or similar event conducted on public property pursuant to an applicable permit. \n\n(d)\nNo person shall be charged with a violation of this section unless the person engages in conduct prohibited by this section after having been notified by a law enforcement officer that the conduct violates this section. \n\n(e)\nThe provisions of this section are declared to be separate and severable. The invalidity of any clause, sentence, paragraph, subdivision, section or portion of this section, or the invalidity of the application thereof to any person or circumstance shall not affect the validity of the remainder of this section, or the validity of its application to other persons or circumstances. \n\n(f)\nAny person who violates this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(Ord.

Persons responsible for the occurrence of disruptive gatherings on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage persons at these gatherings. \n\n(4)\nDue to the differing nature of responsible persons at a given location, the fact that landlords often do not reside at the property and are not in a position to immediately address the impact of a disruptive gathering, and the transient nature of tenants, it has proven difficult to address disruptive gatherings \n\n(5)\nProblems associated with disruptive gatherings at which alcoholic beverages are served, including those where underage persons are permitted to consume alcoholic beverages, are difficult to prevent and deter unless the City of Reno Police Department has the legal authority to direct the host to disperse the gathering. \n\n(6)\nPersons held responsible for abetting or tolerating disruptive gatherings will be more likely to properly supervise or stop such conduct at gatherings held on property under their possession or control. \n\n(7)\nLaw enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel are required to respond, sometimes on multiple occasions, to disruptive gatherings on private property, including those at which alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons. \n\n(8)\nResponses to such gatherings result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources of the City of Reno, which are underwritten by general municipal taxes paid to the city by its taxpayers and residents and delaying police responses to regular and emergency calls to the rest of the city. \n\n(9)\nSuch gatherings are deemed a public nuisance.\n\n(10)\nThe intent of this article is to protect the public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property, and general welfare.\n\n(b)\nPurposes.\nThe purposes of this article are:\n\n(1)\nTo protect public health, safety and general welfare;\n\n(2)\nTo enforce laws prohibiting the service to and consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage persons; and\n\n(3)\nTo reduce the burden on police, fire and other emergency response services caused by disruptive gatherings, including those where alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage persons. \n\n(4)\nTo protect and foster the quiet enjoyment of residential property and prevent the disturbance of the peace of persons thereon.\n\n(c)\nDefinitions.\nFor the purposes of this section, the following terms shall have the following meanings:\n\n(1)\n\"Alcoholic beverage\" means: \n\na.\nBeer, ale, porter, stout and other similar fermented beverages, including sake and similar products, or any name or description containing one-half of one percent or more alcohol by volume, brewed or produced from malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute therefor; \n\nb.\nAny beverage obtained by the fermentation of the natural content of fruits or other agricultural products containing sugar, of not less than one-half of one percent of alcohol by volume; and \n\nc.\nAny distilled spirits commonly referred to as ethyl alcohol, ethanol or spirits of wine in any form, including all dilutions and mixtures thereof from whatever process produced. \n\n(2)\n\"Disruptive gathering\" means a gathering of three or more persons on any private property, including property used to conduct business, in a manner which creates a public nuisance by disturbing the quiet enjoyment of private or public property by any person or persons. Such disturbances include, but are not limited to: \n\na.\nNoise which is likely to disturb the peace of persons of reasonable and ordinary sensibilities;\n\nb.\nExcessive traffic that can reasonably be attributed to the gathering;\n\nc.\nObstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles;\n\nd.\nDrinking in public;\n\ne.\nService of alcohol to, or consumption of alcohol by, underage persons;\n\nf.\nAssaults, batteries, fights, or other disturbances of the peace;\n\ng.\nLittering;\n\nh.\nVandalism; or\n\ni.\nAny other conduct which constitutes a threat to public health, safety, quiet enjoyment of residential property or general welfare. \n\n(3)\n\"Juvenile\" means any person under the age of 18 years of age. \n\n(4)\n\"Residence or other private property\" means a home, yard, apartment, condominium, hotel or motel room, or other dwelling unit, or a hall or meeting room, whether occupied on a temporary or permanent basis, whether occupied as a dwelling or for a party or other social function, and whether owned, leased, rented, or used with or without compensation. \n\n(5)\n\"Underage person\" means any person under 21 years of age. \n\n(d)\nA disruptive gathering is unlawful and constitutes a violation of the Reno Municipal Code. A disruptive gathering may be abated by reasonable means including, but not necessarily limited to: \n\n(1)\nAn order requiring the gathering to be disbanded;\n\n(2)\nCitation or arrest of violators under applicable criminal ordinances or state statutes; and/or\n\n(3)\nIssuance of an administrative citation for failure to comply with the requirements of the Reno Municipal Code, as set forth in RMC Sec. 1.05.200 through RMC Sec. 1.05.220 \n\nAdministrative citations shall be issued pursuant to this chapter only after a warning letter has been issued, and violations are successively, repeatedly or continuously committed at a single residence or other private property. The warning letter shall issue upon the second violation within six months at a single residence or other private property. \n\nAfter a warning letter is issued for the second violation within six months at a single residence or other private property, administrative citations may be issued beginning with the third violation within six months of the second violation, and thereafter, for each following violation without regard to limitations based on a six-month period. Administrative citations may continue to be issued for each violation until there are no further violations at the residence or other private property for a period of one year. Thereafter, in the case of renewed violations at the single residence or other private property, the six-month period limitation shall renew. \n\nThe city will consider evidence of demonstrable good faith efforts on the part of the property owner to abate the nuisance, even if unsuccessful, when determining whether additional administrative action is needed. Such evidence will also be admissible in any administrative appeal conducted in accordance with RMC Chapter 1.05. \n\nIf the offending tenant vacates the property after an administrative process has commenced, the property owner must notify the city. Upon notice, pending administrative actions will be concluded as appropriate. The administrative process will be reinstituted in accordance with the procedure detailed above if there are additional disruptive gatherings with new tenants. \n\nIf the property is sold after an administrative process has commenced, the city must be notified, the purchaser must contact the city to discuss the existing nuisance and measures the purchaser will be taking to abate the nuisance, and all outstanding fines satisfied before the process is concluded. \n\n(e)\nResponsibility for Proper Property Management.\nEvery owner, occupant, lessee or holder of any possessory interest of a residence or other private property within the City of Reno is required to maintain, manage and supervise the property and all persons thereon in a manner so as not to violate the provisions of this section. The owner of the property remains liable for such violations regardless of any contract or agreement with any third party regarding the property. \n\n(f)\nAll provisions calling for administrative enforcement will be enforced in accordance with RMC Chapter 1.05 \n\n(g)\nThe failure to pay administrative fines assessed in accordance with this section may result in a lien being placed upon the property. \n\n(h)\nProtected Activities.\nThis section shall not apply to activities protected by Article I of the United States Constitution.\n\n(Ord.

If the person to be excluded has been excluded from any park at any time within two years before the date of the present exclusion, the exclusion shall be for 120 days. If the person to be excluded has been excluded from one or more parks on two or more occasions within two years before the date of the present exclusion, the exclusion shall be for 180 days. \n\n(d)\nBefore issuing an exclusion under this section, the issuing person shall first give the person a warning and a reasonable opportunity to desist from the violation. An exclusion shall not be issued if the person promptly complies with the direction and desists from the violation. \n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, no warning shall be required if the person is to be excluded for engaging in conduct that: \n\n(1)\nIs classified as a felony or as a gross misdemeanor under any chapter of the Nevada Revised Statutes, or is an attempt, solicitation or conspiracy to commit any such felony or gross misdemeanor as defined in the Nevada Revised Statutes: \n\n(2)\nInvolves a controlled substance; or\n\n(3)\nHas resulted in injury to any person or damage to any property; or\n\n(4)\nIs conduct for which the person previously has been warned or excluded for committing in any park; or\n\n(5)\nConstitutes a violation of any of the following provisions of this Code:\n\na.\nChapter 8.06-Crimes Against Public Administration; \n\nb.\nChapter 8.08-Crimes Against Persons; \n\nc.\nChapter 8.10-Crimes Against Property; \n\nd.\nChapter 8.12-Public Peace except 8.12.035; or \n\ne.\nChapter 8.17-Misdemeanor Marijuana, Drug Paraphernalia and Related Offenses. \n\n\n(e)\nA person receiving such notice of exclusion may appeal to an administrative hearing officer in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 1.05 of this Code. The hearing officer shall uphold the exclusion if, upon the hearings officer's de novo review, the preponderance of evidence admissible under the provisions of Chapter 1.05 of this Code convinces the hearings officer that, more likely than not, the person in fact committed the violation, and if the exclusion is otherwise in accordance with law. \n\n(f)\nIf an appeal of the exclusion is timely filed under Chapter 1.05 of this Code, the effectiveness of the exclusion shall be stayed, pending the outcome of the appeal. If the exclusion is affirmed, the remaining period of exclusion shall be effective immediately upon the issuance of the hearings officer's decision, unless the hearings officer specifies a later effective date. \n\n(g)\nIf a person is issued a subsequent exclusion while a previous exclusion is stayed pending appeal (or pending judicial review, should a court stay the exclusion), the stayed exclusion shall be counted in determining the appropriate length of the subsequent exclusion under section (c) above. If the predicate exclusion is set aside, the term of the subsequent exclusion shall be reduced, as if the predicate exclusion had not been issued. If multiple exclusions issued to a single person for a single park are simultaneously stayed pending appeal, the effective periods of those which are affirmed shall run consecutively. \n\n(h)\nNo person shall enter or remain in any park at any time during which there is in effect a notice of exclusion issued under this section excluding that person from that park. \n\n(i)\nAny person who violates a notice of exclusion is guilty of a misdemeanor.\n\n(Ord.

Protection of this right of the public is a significant government interest. The government has a legitimate interest in minimizing fear, intimidation and unwarranted confrontations of the public during the night hours, a time when criminal activity is more likely to occur. \n\n(d)\nAggressive solicitations threaten these significant government interests by diminishing access to, and use and enjoyment of public places, and also threaten the commercial well being of local businesses, and create an environment of fear, intimidation, and confrontation. \n\n(e)\nSolicitations in certain locations, at certain times affecting a solicitation environment, or in locations where members of the public are less able to avoid solicitations, also threaten these significant government interests. Such solicitations also diminish access to and enjoyment of public places, threaten the commercial well being of local businesses, and create an environment of fear, intimidation, and confrontation. \n\n(f)\nIt is the intent of the council to protect the public from persons who engage in aggressive solicitations, or who engage in other methods of solicitation that diminish or prevent the public's right to access to, and use and enjoyment of public places, but without prohibiting any person's such right and without impinging on the use of the public forum by all. \n\n(g)\nRegulation of solicitation is necessary to meet council's intent; to protect quality of life, economic vitality, health, safety and welfare, and the rights of the public. \n\n\n(Ord.

Acts authorized as an exercise of one's constitutional right to picket or to legally protest, participation in a legal event such as watching a parade or a special event and acts authorized by a permit or license issued pursuant to the Reno Municipal Code, shall not constitute obstruction of pedestrian or vehicular traffic. \n\nPublic place means an area open to the general public, whether publicly or privately owned, and includes alleys, bridges, buildings, driveways, parking lots, parking garages, parks, plazas, sidewalks, streets, any public transportation vehicle and the doorways and entrances to buildings or dwellings and the grounds enclosing them. \n\nResidence means any living unit contained within any building or structure that is occupied by a person as a dwelling consistent with the zoning laws of the city, together with the lot or other real property on which the living unit is located. This does not include the sidewalk, public places, public street, or public rights-of-way. \n\nServices means those intangible goods, personal benefits, or offers of employment offered, provided, or sold to a person. \n\nSolicit or solicitation means and includes any request for, or enticement or action which communicates a request for, any donation or provision of funds, goods or other property.

However, \"solicit\" or \"solicitation\" shall not include the act of passively standing, sitting, or engaging in a performance of art with a sign or other indication that a donation is being sought, without any vocal request other than in response to an inquiry by another person. \n\nSolicitor or solicitors means a person(s) engaged in solicitation or seeking to solicit as defined in this section. \n\n(Ord.

It is unlawful for any person to deviate from the provisions of these specifications. \n\n(Code 1966,  7.08.060) \n\nSec. 12.08.030. - Restrictions on doing work.\n\n(a)\nInterference with traffic.\nNo opening or excavation in any street shall extend beyond the centerline of the street without providing adequate traffic facilities across the opened or excavated portion of the street so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to the general public. \n\n(b)\nInterference with existing facilities.\nThe permittee under this chapter will not interfere with any existing facilities without the consent of the owner of the facility. Pipe drains, culverts, sewer lines, signal conduits or other facilities owned by the city shall not be disturbed without the approval of the city engineer, and the permittee will do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect the facilities. If city facilities are damaged, they shall be repaired at the permittee's expense. \n\n(c)\nLimited to one block.\nNo more than one city block, measured longitudinally, shall be opened in any street at any one time, except by special permission of the city engineer. \n\n(d)\nDisturbance of monuments.\nMonuments of concrete, iron or other lasting material set for the purpose of locating or preserving the lines of any street or property subdivision, or a precise survey reference point or a permanent survey bench mark within the city shall not be removed or disturbed or caused to be removed or disturbed unless permission to do so is first obtained in writing from the city engineer. \n\n(e)\nProtection of adjoining properties.\nThe permittee will at all times and at his own expense preserve and protect from injury any properties adjoining the work.\n\n(f)\nInterference with drainage system.\nWhen work performed by the permittee interferes with the established drainage system of any street, provision shall be made by the permittee to provide proper drainage to the satisfaction of the city engineer. \n\n(g)\nRemoval of material from street.\nWhen any earth, gravel or other excavated material is caused to roll, flow or wash upon any street, the permittee shall cause the same to be removed from the street within 24 hours after deposit. If the earth, gravel or other excavated material so deposited is not removed, the city engineer shall cause such removal and the cost incurred shall be paid by the permittee. \n\n(h)\nBarriers, warning devices.\nEvery permittee shall place around the project such barriers, barricades, lights, warning flags and danger signs as shall be determined by the city engineer to be necessary for the protection of the public. Whenever any permittee fails to provide proper safety devices, within a reasonable time after being notified, such devices may be installed and maintained by the city. The cost incurred shall be paid by the permittee. \n\n(i)\nAccess to essential facilities and private driveways.\nFree access must be provided at all times to fire hydrants and fire stations, and all other vital and essential public structures, equipment and facilities; access to private driveways shall be provided. \n\n(j)\nPlacement of excavated material.\nExcavated materials shall be laid neatly along the side of the trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible to public travel. In order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate a dirt or dust nuisance, the city engineer may require the permittee to provide toe boards or bins; and if the excavated area is muddy and causes inconveniences to pedestrians, temporary wooden plank walks shall be installed by the permittee as directed by the city engineer. \n\n(k)\nConditions for granting permits.\nIn granting any permit, the city engineer may attach such other conditions thereto as may be reasonably necessary to prevent damage to public or private property or to prevent the operation from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property or in a manner likely to create a nuisance. Such conditions may include but shall not be limited to: \n\n(1)\nLimitations on the hour, the day and the period of the year in which the work may be performed;\n\n(2)\nRestrictions as to the size and type of excavating equipment;\n\n(3)\nDesignation of routes upon which materials may be transported;\n\n(4)\nThe manner of removal of excavated materials;\n\n(5)\nRequirements as to the control of dust nuisance, the cleaning of street, the prevention of noise, and other results offensive or injurious to the neighborhood, the general public, or any portion thereof; and \n\n(6)\nRegulations as to the use of streets in the course of the work.\n\n(Code 1966,  7.08.030) \n\nSec. 12.08.040. - Backfilling and restoration.\n\n(a)\nGenerally.\nAll pavement cuts, openings and excavations shall be properly made, backfilled and temporarily surfaced by the permittee under this chapter according to the city specifications. Temporary surfacing must be installed within 24 hours after the trench is backfilled. \n\n(b)\nNotice of beginning of backfilling.\nThe city engineer must be notified by the permittee during the 48 hour period preceding beginning of backfilling of the date and approximate time at which backfilling will be begun. \n\n(c)\nTemporary patching.\nTemporary patching shall be done by the permittee, and it is the responsibility of the permittee to maintain the temporary patch for a period not to exceed 60 days, or until weather conditions permit placement of the permanent patch. \n\n(d)\nFinal restoration of paving surface.\nThe work of final restoration of the paving surface shall be performed by the city under the direction of the city engineer.\n\n(e)\nResurfacing instead of patching.\nIf the city engineer finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the street opening may be damaged where trenches are made parallel to the street, or where a number of cross trenches are laid in close proximity to one another or where the equipment used may cause such damage, he may require a negotiated contribution from the permittee for the resurfacing in place of patching of such street if the total area of the proposed patch or probably damaged area exceeds 25 percent of the total pavement surfacing between curb faces or between concrete gutter edges in any block. Such negotiations shall be carried on and contributions agreed upon prior to issuance of a permit. Such contribution shall be in lieu of the standard permit fee. \n\n(f)\nPerformance of work diligently.\nAfter the excavation is commenced, the work to be performed under the permit shall be prosecuted with due diligence to completion.\n\n(g)\nInspections.\nThe city engineer shall make such inspections as he may deem necessary of all work authorized by a permit.\n\n(h)\nAbandonment of facilities.\nIf the permittee abandons any facilities within the public area, the city may require the permittee to remove at his expense, or to reimburse the city for removal of such abandoned facilities. \n\n(i)\nDepth of facilities.\nThe top of any structure or facility, excepting entrances thereto, shall not hereinafter be placed less than eighteen (18) inches below the surface of a public area unless approved by the city engineer. \n\n(j)\nCertificate of final inspection.\nThe permittee shall notify the city engineer in writing upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of the permit. A certificate of final inspection will be issued by the city engineer to each permittee no sooner than three years after the permanent restoration of the excavation has been made, provided the work authorized by the permit has been performed according to city specifications. Any settlement in a restored area which has occurred within the three year period, following completion of the permanent restoration shall be repaired by the permittee or any expense incurred by the city in correcting such settlement shall be paid by the permittee unless the permittee submits proof satisfactory to the city engineer that the settlement was not due to defective backfilling. \n\n(Code 1966,  7.08.040) \n",

These dischargers may require a cursory inspection to verify specific operations within these facilities upon start up or relocation of the business. \n\n(2)\nHazard Class II:\nThose commercial/industrial establishments with sanitary facilities, floor drains and/or kitchen facilities and/or laundry facilities which may discharge domestic-type sewage of a strength greater than that normally discharged from a domestic dwelling. These establishments will have a minimal potential of discharging toxic materials to the system, and will have a requirement to pretreat or dispose of wastes in a regulated manner. Also, those commercial/industrial establishments which have small amounts of toxic materials or waste on hand but which present only a slight hazard of being discharged to the system. These establishments will normally be inspected and have records verified once per year. \n\n(3)\nHazard Class III:\nThose commercial/industrial establishments whose waste stream may contain materials which are not considered toxic, but which are not treatable by the treatment plant, or which could potentially cause a hazard to the system. Those establishments whose discharge contains constituents other than those found in domestic-type sewage. Those establishments which store and/or repackage or generate large amounts of hazardous (toxic) materials or waste which are not normally discharged to the system but which could enter the system through floor drains and thus present a potential hazard to the system. Those businesses that have multiple pretreatment systems and multiple operations at one facility that require more time consuming and complex inspections. These businesses will normally be inspected and have records verified once per year but may require additional inspections or records verification. \n\n(4)\nHazard Class IV:\nThose industrial/commercial establishments which in their normal operations, would use and/or generate a large quantity of hazardous material or waste but do not pretreat or discharge these materials to the sewer. These dischargers are subject to federal pretreatment requirements and are classified as Categorical industries. These establishments shall be inspected and have records varied at least four times per year. \n\n(5)\nHazard Class V:\nThose industrial/commercial dischargers which are subject to federal pretreatment requirements and are classified as Categorical industries or significant industrial dischargers and that discharge a waste stream that may contain toxic or hazardous materials and the city monitors this discharge to insure it meets discharge requirements. These establishments are inspected and have their discharge sampled at least four times per year. \n\n(b)\nAll industrial/commercial dischargers must provide information to the director detailing the type of business operation and estimated discharge strength and flow. Dischargers will be classified based upon this information. All industrial commercial dischargers who are not classified as Class I dischargers must obtain a wastewater discharge permit from the director.

Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or discharged shall allow the city representatives ready access to all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purpose of inspection, sampling, records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. To verify the discharge flows and strength reported by a discharger or to determine compliance with this ordinance, inspection, measurement, and sampling may be conducted periodically by the city. The city may install, maintain and operate necessary sampling and measuring equipment on the premises of the discharger. Where a user has security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon presentation with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. \n\n(Ord. No. 2899,  1 (7.20.135), 8-25-80; Ord. No. 3924,  13, 2-27-90; Ord. No. 4038,  7, 12-11-90) \n\nSec. 12.16.660. - Pretreatment.\n\n(a)\nThe director may require users to pretreat wastewater. Users shall make wastewater acceptable under the limitations established herein before discharging into any wastewater facility. Upon written notice from the city of the requirement for pretreatment of discharge, the user shall have ten working days to reply to the director as to a plan of compliance and shall be in compliance within 90 days unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the city. Any facilities required to pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the city shall be provided and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operation procedures shall be submitted to the director for review, and shall be approved by the director before construction of the facility. The review and approval of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent complying with the provisions of this article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be approved by the director. \n\n(b)\nThe director may require users to pretreat wastewater to meet best practicable control technology performance standards for pollutants not regulated under section 12.16.580 \n\n(c)\nThe director may require that industrial/commercial dischargers provide information that concentrations of hazardous constituents contained within their wastewater, but not regulated under section 12.16.580, will not pass-through the treatment works, interfere with the operation of the treatment works, limit disposal of municipal sludge, present a fire or explosion hazard, cause structural damage to wastewater facilities or obstruct flow, nor pose a threat to the health and safety of workers. This information shall include supporting data and analysis and shall be prepared by a professional engineer licensed in the State of Nevada experienced in sanitary design. \n\n(d)\nThe city shall annually publish in a newspaper printed and published in the City of Reno a list of the users which were not in compliance with any pretreatment requirements or standards at least once during the 12 previous months. The notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the user(s) during the same 12 months. \n\n(Ord. No. 2899,  1 (7.20.136), 8-25-80; Ord. No. 3506,  1, 5-11-87; Ord. No. 3924,  14, 2-27-89) \n\nSec. 12.16.670. - Monitoring equipment and reports.\n\n(a)\nThe director may require the user, at his own expense, to construct, operate and maintain monitoring facilities and equipment, in order to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer or internal drainage systems. \n\n(1)\nWhen more than one user can discharge into a common building sewer, the director may require installation of a separate monitoring facility for each user. Also when, in the judgment of the director, there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and characteristics produced by different operations of a single user the director may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each separate discharge. \n\n(2)\nMonitoring facilities that are required to be installed shall be constructed, operated and maintained at the user's expense. The purpose of the facility is to enable inspection, sampling and flow measurement of wastewaters produced by a user. If sampling or metering equipment is also required by the director it shall be provided, installed and operated at the user's expense. The monitoring facility will normally be required to be located on the user's premises outside of the building. The director may, however, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, with the approval of the public agency having jurisdiction over that street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. \n\n(3)\nIf the monitoring facility is inside the user's fence, there shall be accommodations to allow safe and immediate access for city personnel, such as a gate secured with a city lock. There shall be ample room in or near such facility to allow accurate sampling and compositing of samples for analysis. The entire facility and the sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by and at the expense of the user. \n\n(4)\nWhether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local agency construction standards and specifications. \n\n(5)\nWhen, in the judgment of the city, an existing user requires a monitoring facility, the user will be so notified in writing. Construction must be completed within 90 days following written notification unless a time extension is otherwise granted by the city. \n\n(b)\nWithin 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable discharge limitations or, in the case of a new source, following commencement of the discharge to the system, any industrial/commercial discharger subject to such limitations shall submit to the director a report indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited and the average maximum daily flow for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such discharge limitations. The report shall state whether the applicable discharge limitations are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the user and certified to and by a qualified professional. \n\n(c)\n(1) Any user subject to a discharge limitation after the compliance date of such discharge limitation, or, in the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge, shall submit to the director during the months of June and December, unless required more frequently or at different intervals, by the director, a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by the discharge limitation. \n\n(2)\nThe director may impose mass limitations when appropriate. In such cases, the report required in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall indicate the mass pollutants. \n\n(Ord. No. 2899,  1 (7.20.137), 8-25-80) \n",

These dischargers may require a cursory inspection to verify specific operations within these facilities upon start up or relocation of the business. \n\n(2)\nClass II:\nThose commercial/industrial establishments with storm water collection facilities, which may discharge storm water of a strength greater than that normally discharged from domestic dwelling. These establishments will have a minimal potential of discharging toxic materials to the system, and may have a requirement to pretreat storm water in a regulated manner. Also, those commercial/industrial establishments which have small amounts of toxic materials or waste on hand but which present only a slight hazard of being discharged to the system. These establishments will normally be inspected and have records verified once per year. \n\n(3)\nClass III:\nThose commercial/industrial establishments whose storm water may contain materials which may be considered toxic, but which are not treatable or which could potentially cause a hazard to the system. Those establishments which store and/or repackage or generate large amounts of hazardous (toxic) materials or waste which are not normally discharged to the system but which could enter the system through stormwater collection facilities and thus present a potential hazard to the system. Those businesses that have multiple pretreatment systems and multiple operations at one facility that require more time consuming and complex inspections. These businesses will normally be inspected and have records verified once per year but may require additional inspections or records verification. \n\n(4)\nClass IV:\nThose industrial/commercial dischargers which are subject to federal storm water regulations and are classified as categorical industries or significant industrial dischargers that discharge storm water that may contain toxic or hazardous materials and the city monitors this discharge to assure it meets discharge requirements. These establishments are inspected 4 times a year with sampling during storm water events. \n\n(b)\nDischargers will be classified based upon this information. All industrial commercial dischargers who are not classified as Class I dischargers must obtain a storm water discharge permit from the public works director. It is unlawful for these industrial/commercial users to discharge to the system without such a permit. \n\n(Ord. No. 5469,  1, 7-16-03) \n\nSec. 12.16.2000. - Storm water permit application and fees.\n\n(a)\nTo obtain a storm water discharge permit, the industrial/commercial user shall complete and file with the public works director an application in the form prescribed by the public works director. The application shall require the following information: \n\n(1)\nName, address and Standard Industrial Classification (S.I.C.) number or numbers of applicants;\n\n(2)\nEstimated volume of storm water to be discharged;\n\n(3)\nStorm water constituents and characteristics as prescribed by the public works director;\n\n(4)\nSite plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing plans, and details to show all storm drain and appurtenances by size, location, and elevation as required by the public works director; \n\n(5)\nDescription of business activities including type of products, raw materials used, variation in operation, and number and type of employees; \n\n(6)\nAny other information as may be deemed by the public works director to be necessary to evaluate the permit application.\n\n(b)\nThe public works director will evaluate the data furnished by the discharger. After evaluation and approval of all data required, the public works director may issue a storm water discharge permit subject to terms and conditions provided herein. \n\n(c)\nBefore a new industrial/commercial discharger to the city's storm water collection facilities is allowed, the discharger must first obtain a storm water discharge permit. All existing industrial/commercial dischargers must complete and submit to the public works director a permit application for industrial/commercial storm water discharge permit. Violation of this provision shall subject the discharger to enforcement and penalties as provided in Division 4 of this article. \n\n(d)\nFees for wastewater discharge permits and monitoring shall be determined in accordance with a set list of fees approved by the city council and kept on file in the office of the city engineer and payable upon billing by the city. \n\n(Ord.

No. 5351,  1, 6-11-02) \n\nSec. 12.28.955. - Expansion of maintenance district.\n\nUpon the filing of a petition and compliance with this ordinance, and following review and acceptance by the city given the parameters of this ordinance, a maintenance district may be expanded to include future phases of the subdivision.

If city council determines it is not desirable to continue maintenance district, such district may be dissolved in accordance with RMC section 12.28.060. In such event, an association for a common-interest community must be formed within six months by petitioner(s) or the owners that are subject to assessment to maintain landscaping, public lighting, and security wall in lieu of a maintenance district under NRS 278.4787.

All bracing systems shall be designed and constructed to transfer lateral forces to the foundations. For signs on buildings the dead and lateral loads shall be transmitted through the structural frame of the building to the ground in such manner as not to overstress any of the elements thereof. \n\nThe overturning moment produced from lateral forces shall in no case exceed two-thirds of the dead-load resisting moment. Uplift due to overturning shall be adequately resisted by proper anchorage to the ground or to the structural frame of the building. The weight of earth superimposed over footings may be used in determining the dead-load resisting moment. Such earth shall be carefully placed and thoroughly compacted. \n\n(b)\nWind design.\nEvery sign structure shall be designed and constructed to resist the wind effects determined in accordance with the current Uniform Building Code. The minimum basic wind speed for determining design wind pressure shall be 30 pounds per square foot. \n\n(c)\nSeismic loads.\nSigns and sign structures shall be designed and constructed to resist seismic forces as specified in Chapter 23 of the building code. \n\n(d)\nCombined loads.\nWind and seismic loads need not be combined in the design of signs or sign structures; only that loading producing the larger stresses need be used.

The response from the appraiser must include (i) a statement of specific qualifications to do the type of appraisal required, (ii) a proposal of the terms and conditions for the appraisal; (iii) a disclosure statement which includes, without limitation, all sources of income of the appraiser that may constitute a conflict of interest and any relationship of the appraiser with the property owner or the owner of an adjoining property; and (iv) a statement that the appraiser is not related within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity to any person who has an interest in the real property or an adjoining property. \n\n(2)\nIf the appraiser does not satisfactorily respond to the request as determined by the director, his or her name shall be moved to the bottom of the list, and the director shall move to the next name on the list. If the appraiser responds to the request in terms that are responsive and satisfactory to the director, his or her name shall be recommended to the city council for approval as specified in section 15.01.100 below. \n\n(3)\nIf more than one appraisal is required, this procedure shall be followed for each appraiser. To expedite the selection process or foster competitive bidding, the director may send a request for proposal to more than one appraiser, and those who respond and are not selected shall be left at the top of the list. \n\n(4)\nOnce the resolution of intent is adopted by the city council as set forth in section 15.01.100, the director shall engage the qualified appraisers to conduct appraisals utilizing the approved form agreement for appraisal services. \n\n\n(Ord.

Of the proposals submitted which conform to all terms and conditions specified in the resolution of intent referenced in section 15.01.100, above, and which are made by responsible bidders, the bid which is the highest must be finally accepted unless a higher oral bid is accepted at the public meeting or the city council rejects all bids. \n\n(b)\nAt the public meeting and before accepting any written bid, city council shall call for oral bids. If, upon the call for oral bidding, any responsible person offers to buy or lease the property upon the terms and conditions specified in the resolution of intent for a price exceeding by at least five percent the highest written bid, then the highest oral bid which is made by a responsible person must be finally accepted, unless provided otherwise in this chapter. \n\n(c)\nThe final acceptance by the city council may be made either at the same session or at any adjourned session of the same public meeting held within the following 21 days. \n\n(d)\nThe city council may, either at the same session or at any adjourned session of the same public meeting held within the following 21 days, if it deems the action to be for the best public interest, reject any and all bids, either written or oral, and withdraw the property from sale or lease. \n\n(e)\nIf the property is not sold or leased at the initial offering, the city council may offer the property for sale or lease a second time pursuant to this chapter. If there is a material change relating to the title, zoning or an ordinance governing the use of the property, a new appraisal must be obtained pursuant to section 15.01.090 before offering the property for sale or lease a second time. If the property is not sold or leased at the second offering, the city council may list the property for sale or lease at the appraised value with a licensed real estate broker, provided the broker or a person related to the broker within the first degree of consanguinity or affinity does not have an interest in the property or an adjoining property. \n\n(f)\nAny resolution of acceptance of any bid made by city council shall authorize and direct the mayor to execute a deed or lease and authorize the city manager, or his designee, to deliver it upon performance and compliance by the purchaser or lessor with all the terms or conditions of his contract which are to be performed concurrently therewith. \n\n(g)\nThe city council may require any person requesting that real property be sold pursuant to the provisions of this section to deposit a sufficient amount of money to pay the costs to be incurred by the city council in acting upon the application, including the costs of publication and the expenses of appraisal. This deposit must be refunded whenever the person making the deposit is not the successful bidder. The costs of acting upon the application, including the costs of publication and the expenses of appraisal, must be borne by the successful bidder. \n\n(Ord. No. 5795,  2, 1-11-06; Ord. No. 5991,  2, 12-12-07) \n\nSec. 15.01.140. - Violations and penalties.\n\nIf real property is sold or leased in violation of the provisions of this chapter: \n\n(1)\nThe sale or lease is void; and\n\n(2)\nAny change to an ordinance or law governing the zoning or use of the real property is void if the change takes place within five years after the date of void sale or lease. \n\n\n(Ord. No. 5991,  2, 12-12-07) \n\nSec. 15.01.150. - Exceptions.\n\n(a)\nThis chapter applies:\n\n(1)\nExcept as otherwise provided in NRS 268.048 to 268.058, inclusive;\n\n(2)\nExcept as otherwise provided under NRS 278.479 to 278.4965, inclusive;\n\n(3)\nExcept as otherwise required by federal law;\n\n(4)\nExcept as otherwise required pursuant to a cooperative agreement entered into pursuant to NRS 277.050 or 277.053;\n\n(5)\nExcept as otherwise provided in an interlocal agreement in existence on October 1, 2004;\n\n(6)\nExcept if city council is entering into a joint development agreement for real property owned by the city to which the city is a party; \n\n(7)\nExcept for a lease of residential property with a term of one year or less;\n\n(8)\nExcept for the sale or lease of real property to a public utility, as defined in NRS 704.020, to be used for a public purpose;\n\n(9)\nExcept for the sale or lease of real property to the state or another governmental entity;\n\n(10)\nExcept for the sale of lease of real property larger than one acre which is approved by the voters at a primary or general election, primary or general city election or special election; \n\n(11)\nExcept if the property is being sold to a person who owns real property located adjacent to the property and city council adopts a resolution which finds that the sale of the property is either (a) a remnant that was separated from its original parcel due to the construction of a street, alley, avenue or other thoroughfare, or portion thereof, flood control facility or other public facility; (b) a parcel that, as a result of its size, is too small to establish an economically viable use by anyone other than the person who owns real property adjacent to the property; or (c) a parcel which is subject to a deed restriction prohibiting the use of the property by anyone other than the person who owns real property adjacent to the property, and that the sale or lease will be in the best interest of the city; \n\n(12)\nExcept if the sale or lease of the property is to the state or another governmental entity and (i) the sale or lease restricts the use of the property to a public use, and (ii) city council adopts a resolution finding that the sale or lease will be in the best interest of the city; and \n\n(13)\nExcept as provided in subsection (b) and (c) next below.\n\n(b)\nProperty may be sold, leased or conveyed by the city for the purposes of redevelopment or economic development without first offering the property to the public; and for less than fair market value of the property. However, an appraisal or appraisals, as applicable, pursuant to section 15.01.090 of this chapter must be obtained, and city council must adopt a resolution finding that it is in the best interests of the public to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the property without offering the property to the public and for less than the fair market value. \n\n(c)\nNonprofit organizations.\n\n(1)\nThe city may lease property to a nonprofit organization that:\n\na.\nIs recognized as exempt under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code;\n\nb.\nIs affiliated by contract or other written agreement with the city; and\n\nc.\nProvides to residents of the city or to other persons a service that the city would otherwise be required to expend money to provide, under such terms and for such consideration as the city council determines reasonable based upon the costs and benefits to the city and the recommendation of any city officers who may be involved in approving the lease. \n\n(2)\nTo lease real property pursuant to this section, the city council must approve the lease and establish the recommended amount of rent to be received for the real property. The city council shall render a decision on an application to lease real property pursuant to this section within 60 days after it receives the application. \n\n(3)\nIn determining the amount of rent for the lease of real property pursuant to this section, consideration must be given to:\n\na.\nThe amount the lessee is able to pay;\n\nb.\nWhether the real property will be used by the lessee to perform a service of value to members of the general public;\n\nc.\nWhether the service to be performed on the real property will be of assistance to any agency of the city; and\n\nd.\nThe expenses, if any, that the city is likely to incur to lease real property pursuant to this section in comparison to other potential uses of the real property. \n\n(4)\nThe city council may waive any fee for the consideration of an application submitted pursuant to this section.\n\n(Ord.
